      <h1>Bad Actors Album</h1>
      <p>
        Listen to the unapologetic debut album written and produced by Matthew Reardon, 
        exposing lies through hard-hitting tracks.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Album Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The &quot;Bad Actors&quot; album is more than musicâ€”it&apos;s a form of journalism. 
        Each track confronts institutional corruption, police overreach, 
        and the silencing of dissent in America.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Artist Background</h2>
      <p>
        Matthew Reardon brings his experience as an investigative journalist 
        and constitutional rights activist to this album, creating music that 
        challenges listeners to think critically about power and accountability.
