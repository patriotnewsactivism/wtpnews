      <h1>Constitutional Rights Legal Research Tool</h1>
      <p>
        A first-of-its-kind platform designed for journalists, civil rights attorneys, 
        auditors, activists, and concerned citizens who refuse to accept a fragmented Constitution.
      </p>
      
      <h2>One Constitution, 51 Interpretations</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're being detained in Texas, recording police in Mississippi, 
        or organizing a protest in California, the reality is this: your constitutional 
        rights are not enforced equally across jurisdictions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This tool exposes that fact — not as an opinion, but as a forensic mapping 
        of law, precedent, and enforcement hostility, state by state, circuit by circuit.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Search any U.S. jurisdiction to reveal:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop-and-identify statutes and penalties</li>
        <li>Federal circuit hostility levels (including circuits where §1983 cases are dead-on-arrival)</li>
        <li>First Amendment landmark cases specific to each state</li>
        <li>Qualified immunity standards and §1983 success rates</li>
        <li>State constitutional protections that go beyond the federal minimums</li>
        <li>Immediate tactical guidance if confronted by law enforcement</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Built for the Front Lines of Constitutional Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        This is not your average academic resource. It was built by a journalist 
        and constitutional rights activist, forged through years of direct confrontation 
        with government overreach, and designed for real-world use in high-stakes situations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        From the 5th Circuit's pattern of civil rights hostility to states with 
        no obligation to show ID, the tool breaks down complex doctrine into actionable, 
        jurisdiction-specific insight. You'll know what's required, what's protected, 
        and what to say when those rights are threatened.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Smarter Audits. Safer Protests. Sharper Lawsuits.</h3>
      <p>
        Are you preparing a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983? 
        Are you filming a First Amendment audit in a hostile district? 
        Are you trying to educate your community about state surveillance, 
        forced ID laws, or police abuse of discretion?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This tool doesn't just inform — it arms you.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why This Tool Matters Right Now</h2>
      <p>
        In 2025, as state and federal institutions become more adversarial toward 
        press freedom, dissent, and protest, knowledge isn't just power — it's survival.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With hostile circuit rulings like McKesson v. Doe threatening protest organizers 
        with liability, and states like Texas and Louisiana punishing lawful conduct 
        with unconstitutional overreach, the terrain has shifted. Activists need to 
        understand not just what the Constitution says, but how it's applied — or ignored — 
        in their jurisdiction.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This tool is your map through that legal minefield.
