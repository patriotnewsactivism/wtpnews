    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:17px;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;text-transform:uppercase\">I received word from one of my YouTube Subscribers informing me that he had sent a detailed email to the Batesville, MS Mayor Hal Ferrell as well as the VFW Posts in the Panola County area condemning one of the city’s newest ordinances that has been hailed as unconstitutional.</h2>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:17px;font-style:normal;font-weight:600\">All I can say after reading it, is WOW! Job well done, David.  Job incredibly done! David is a proud and patriotic US Army Veteran, and I thank him for his time and dedication to ensuring our safety and our freedom. Here is what David had to say:</h3>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Hello, Mr Mayor, Board of Aldermen Members, and Treasured Members Of Sardis Memorial VFW Post 12121 and VFW Post 4968</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I hope everyone is having a good day today! I really appreciate all of the long hours of hard work and dedication it takes to run a City Government, as a former Government official myself! Because I am interested in local government, I frequent the internet to learn what different local government bodies do similarly and differently. Upon my research into the City of Batesville ,I discovered something rather perplexing and quite disturbing!</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Where do I begin? A City of Batesville Ordinance passed by the Board in July of 2022 making it “unlawful” and a “misdemeanor” to record in the publicly accessible areas of the local city government, is in direct opposition to the Constitutional Rights of all Citizens of the United States Of America, Mississippi, Panola County and City of Batesville! As a U.S Army Veteran, I am sickened by this, knowing first hand the level of Selfless Sacrifice made by hundreds of thousands men and women, so we can enjoy the Freedoms we have in Our Country! In North Korea, All foreign tourists are assigned two North Korean minders who decide where tourists eat and what they see and do. In this video, we see Public Servants acting as if The City Of Batesville were a town in North Korea! Moreover,The City Of Batesville now has an Ordnance similar to what one may see in the DPRK! This Ordnance is an attempt to shield the Government from the scrutiny of its citizens! It is not based in any Constitutional Law or case law.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Taking photographs and the Recording of things that are plainly visible from public spaces is a constitutional right and that includes inside federal buildings, transportation facilities, and recording police and other government officials carrying out their duties. If the behavior of a Citizen Journalist interferes with the operation of government or the ability of other members of the public to use a public facility, a Citizen Journalist may be removed from public property they would otherwise be entitled to be in.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Note that such a disruption would have to consist of more than the mere act of recording. In order to be lawfully removed the Journalist’s actions must make it impossible for city business to continue in an orderly fashion. Profane or abusive language doesn’t create a sufficient disruption by itself, either—only if such language qualifies as a physical threat or “fighting words” (words that inflict injury themselves or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace) or if the act (not just the content) of speaking itself disrupts city business, is there cause for members of the public to be removed.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The First Amendment Of the U.S Constitution states; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In the United States, there is and can be no legal requirement or accreditation of any kind required to assume the titles “member of the press”, “journalist”, “reporter”, etc. Simply put, any Citizen of the United States can pick up a camera and be a journalist to distribute information about matters to the public interest.The Citizen Journalist in the video was conducting a Constitutionally protected activity from publicly accessible spaces. If the general public are permitted to be there, so can the Press.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When one is in public, the law holds that a person cannot expect to have a high degree of privacy. Thus, surveillance cameras, audio recording devices, and other forms of in-person or remote observation and recording are legal.Feelings are not to interfere with our Constitutional Protected Rights! Further, The freedom of the press, protected by the First Amendment, is critical to a democracy in which the government is accountable to the people. A free media functions as a watchdog that can investigate and report on government wrongdoing. It is also a vibrant marketplace of ideas, a vehicle for ordinary citizens to express themselves and gain exposure to a wide range of information and opinions.</p>\n<p>Sure, It’s easy to empathise with the emotions and feelings of these hard working ladies in the video! Remember, history is fraught with unscrupulous laws based on feelings…. Jim Crow Laws were just some of them not too long ago!</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I urge all American Citizens, especially my fellow Veterans, to oppose this unlawful Ordnance with the same tenacity the Bravest of Us ALL had when They gave all to preserve our Rights as Americans! It may seem trivial to some but I’ll leave you with some words of warning spoken by the Founding Fathers Of Our Great Country to help aid you in your pondering on this important issue;</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">“The people are the ultimate guardians of their own liberties.In every government on earth is some trace of human weakness, some germ of corruption and degeneracy. Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone.”<br/>Thomas Jefferson</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">“I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.”<br/>James Madison</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">This is a Link to the Video inspiring this email. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xn7rFwo3uYg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xn7rFwo3uYg</a> Please remember it will be seen around the world and across our Nation!</p>\n<p>Please Respond, but more importantly take action!</p>\n<p><strong>David N U.S Army Veteran</strong></p>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:50px\"></div>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:25px\"></div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[21][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xn7rFwo3uYg?feature=oembed\" title=\"Loudmouth Karen gets CHALLENGED!

It creates an independent record of what took place in a particular incident, one that is free from accusations of bias, lying, or faulty memory. Unfortunately, law enforcement officers have been known to ask people to stop taking photographs or recording video of public places. Those who fail to comply have sometimes been harassed, detained, and arrested. When in public spaces where you are lawfully present you have the right to photograph or record anything that is in plain view. That includes pictures and video of federal buildings, transportation facilities, and police. Such photography and video recording is a form of public oversight over the government and is important in a free society</p>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:50px\"></div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[9][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\nhttps://youtu.be/I-2AAToJ6WI\n</div><figcaption>1st Amendment Audit turns into 5th Amendment Audit outside of Federal Contractor 0Building</figcaption></figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:20px\"></div>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:20px\"></div>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><strong>HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF 1ST AMENDMENT AUDITS</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[14][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_NPxQGWCm8?feature=oembed\" title=\"1st Amendment Audit 6/8/22 at Lafayette County Justice Court was another Failure for Sheriffs Dept\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption>On 6/8/2022 Matt Reardon visits Lafayette County Justice Court to find the answers to a few questions.

He says it amounts to a full scale attack on the Constitution and if left unchecked, poses one of the largest threats to society as a whole!</h2>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">On Tuesday June 28, 2022, just prior to a scheduled Chancery Court Hearing commencing, Matt Reardon was taken into Custody by Lafayette County Sheriffs Department due to an arrest warrant that stemmed from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations on June 27th.  Reardon was charged with Aggravated Stalking after he walked in to Oxford, MS City Hall with a camera phone to record the publicly accessible spaces and then request public records. Something Reardon says is called a First Amendment Audit and is completely protected as being constitutional under the First Amendment including a plethora of Federal case law backing that up. The sole issue that State and Local Officials relied upon in their filing of this Felony Charge against Reardon was a restraining order that was taken out in 2017 by the then Mayor-Elect, Robyn Tannehill, whom they alleged was inside of City Hall at the time Reardon entered, although no contact was made nor did Reardon even attempt to make any type of contact with.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">After the initial $10,000 appearance bond set by Circuit Court Judge Kent Smith was revoked at the request of the District Attorneys Office, Reardon sat confined and fully deprived of his freedom and liberty for 3-months time. Over the course of that time, Reardon was hit with several orders and timely deadlines requiring his response to ongoing litigation in not just one, not even two, <strong>but three separate courts</strong>, both State and Federal.  Unfortunately the conditions of his incarceration would ultimately deprive and prevent  him from providing his response within the timeframe required by each Court. Of these included a Motion for Dismissal coincidentally filed the DAY AFTER Reardon was arrested (June 29, 2022) where the State of Mississippi sought the dismissal of an ongoing <strong><a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/lawsuit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Lawsuit that Reardon had filed back in April</a></strong> alleging a plethora of Civil Rights Violations stemming from an alleged Conspiracy involving State and County Officials, along with Employees of Communicare.  Reardon had until September 15, 2022 to respond to the pending motion, however he was unable to respond to the States Motion for Dismissal due to the conditions of his incarceration and a lack of resources or ability to do so. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14622\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221002_191014.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignfull has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped columns-default wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":1,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wtpnews.org\\/full-blown-constitutional-crisis-develops-in-lafayette-county-ms\\/\"}'>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14629\" data-id=\"14629\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[5][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure>\n</figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:36px\"></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">What strikes even more of a “coincidence” is that Reardon was currently Appealing the denial of his Post Conviction Relief Petition which raised multiple alleged fatal flaws and Constitutional Rights Violations in an attempt to directly challenge his Plea in 2017. This appeal had been filed and assigned to the Mississippi Court of Appeals, and the court was awaiting Reardon’s submission of a corrected motion for rehearing after Reardon asked the Court to recall his timely filed motion in order to fix certain discrepancies and printing errors. On June 27, 2022,  just days after Reardon made this request, orders reportedly came down the Chain of Command for The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to Charge Matthew Reardon with one count of Aggravated Stalking, a Felony Charge.  Due to the confinement that would follow with his bond now revoked, Reardon was unable to submit the necessary Motion for Rehearing into the Court of Appeals in order to keep his Appeal alive and potentially going before The Mississippi Supreme Court via a Writ or Certiorari.  A successful reversal or relief granted on the appeal would potentially be a major issue for the District Attorney’s Office in that this new charge <strong><em>REQUIRES a previous similar conviction within the past 7 years</em></strong> in order for them to bring such a serious charge. A potential make or break moment for the District Attorney’s Office. A June 28th arrest, however, would stop Reardon from his opportunity to prevail on appeal and would effectively seal the deal for the County and the State in more ways than just one</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14631\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[8][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-2.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:48px\"></div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14624\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[10][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1325.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:36px\"></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">On August 24 with Reardon nearing 2 months incarceration, he received a third and final order.  This order would come from Lafayette County Chancery Court Judge Robert Whitwell regarding lengthy litigation involving Reardon’s first born child that has seemingly dragged out in and out of the court house for years. This order would essentially close out Reardon’s claims presented to the court in an order of dismissal with prejudice after he was unable to argue it’s facts and merits on June 28, 2022 when he was taken into custody prior to walking into the courtroom in Chancery Court.  Prior to walking into the courtroom Reardon was advised that the Judge had ordered all entering be searched for any cell phones or recording devices, however, this move was unprecedented as it had never before been ordered and required.  Furthermore, Reardon claims that such an order was aimed solely at him, that it authorized an unlawful search and seizure in violation of his Fourth Amendment Rights, and was unenforceable as the Court never first sought permission of such a requirement by the Supreme Court in advance as would be required.  In the order Reardon received August 24th, Whitwell claimed among other things that not only was Reardon’s visitation rights with his daughter severed, but his joint legal custody of his daughter was severed by the court.  Reardon would ultimately be on the time-clock to dispute the ruling with 30-days to do so. Unfortunately as with the other required responses, Reardon found himself without the ability to do so due to his confinement. See the order for yourself below</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-tropicalista-pdfembed\" data-apikey=\"2e5075d83ca641868966042de1bbfe17\" data-dockpagecontrols=\"true\" data-embedmode=\"SIZED_CONTAINER\" data-enableformfilling=\"true\" data-filename=\"8-24-22-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf\" data-mediaurl=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8-24-22-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf\" data-showannotationtools=\"true\" data-showdownloadpdf=\"true\" data-showfullscreen=\"true\" data-showpagecontrols=\"true\" data-showprintpdf=\"true\" id=\"75ace43c-c84f-4602-9193-d3e12755a8dd\" style=\"height:500px\"></div>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:40px\"></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">On September 30, 2022 and At the strong advisement of his public defender based upon risks at trial beginning with the State and County exploiting loopholes in their own criminal statute and applying uncanny political influence, Reardon offered a plea of guilty and was given 5-Years unsupervised probation (non-reporting) along with him being banished from Lafayette County for the same period of time. This marks the second time now Lafayette County has applied Wild West Justice and told Reardon to get out of town. Reardon says he was set on taking this matter to trial, seeking full vindication on the alleged charge, however he was advised that his best viable option to regain his freedom was to take the plea and agree to the banishment due to uncertainty that would come at a jury trial, the highly influential people involved, and the testimony given by the 8 individuals that testified against Reardon at his preliminary hearing which led to the revocation of his bail.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">The following day after Reardon was released from the Lafayette County Detention Center following his 3-month stay, he formally addressed the matter for the first time while ripping into the local news agencies for grandstanding and capitalizing  on a matter that should have been heavily scrutinized and furthers shielding information that should have been disseminated to the public. This is what Reardon had to say:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“I plan on giving a more detailed response in the upcoming days regarding the serious legal matter that resulted from my walking into Oxford, MS City Hall on June 20, 2022 to conduct what I clearly stated was a Constitutionally Protected and completely harmless 1st Amendment Audit of the inside of City Hall as an Independent Journalist. In the meantime I need to stress a few things that have been weighing on my mind. I know my actions were clearly self evidenced in the video below which was uploaded to YouTube the same day, and the absolutely despicable charge of aggravated stalking levied against me 1-week later. Then there is the revocation of the initial appearance bond given, followed by the subsequent incarceration of me for 3 months during a time when my wife and kids needed me the most which demonstrate without a doubt the largest grandstanding overreaction by Lafayette County and it’s officials. The completely biased articles written by Magnolia State Live and HottyToddy.com and The Oxford Eagle show one side of everything which was HIGHLY doctored and manipulated. To make matters even worse I have no doubt that the latest unfair and completely biased attacks are far from over. I believe the resulting damage caused by The State of Mississippi, Local Officials, and particularly these media outlets have left a permanent stain on the Constitutional Rights afforded to all citizens. Most certainly in regards to Freedom of the Press and Journalism. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist, and quite honestly it doesn’t take one with an IQ above 20, to see in the Video of that which transpired that I never once asked to see Mayor Robyn Tannehill, never once saw Mayor Robyn Tannehill, and never did anything remotely perceivable as a threat. I was, as stated from the beginning, solely engaged in a constitutionally protected activity of simply filming the publicly accessible spaces and the decorated interior of City Hall, A PUBLIC BUILDING! It never had the slightest involvement with the Mayor as was unfairly blown out of proportion. A contempt violation on a five year old restraining order should have been it and even that would be highly questionable. Certainly not a Felony Charge of Aggravated Stalking, AND MOST DEFINITELY not getting ransacked with BOTH! We live in a cruel, sick, and sinister society that continues to digress in showing it’s ugly, dirty hand that always seems to revolve around politics. I know I have God on my side. I’m far from a “monster” as was reported from the slew of untrue testimony from the ones that truly deserve that label. There is Pure evil in the hearts of some in this county. In the Bible, Luke 12 verse 2-3 sums it up perfectly in saying that “the secrets will be uncovered, the truth will come forth, and God’s thought about every behavior and action will be vindicated. What’s done in the dark will come to light, and thank God he has created it to operate so!” The legal system has lost its integrity. The “Community” has lost its morals and decency. It’s ludicrous to me that People charged with manslaughter and murder are given bonds in this same God-Forsaken County, meanwhile I had NO weapon, threatened ABSOLUTELY no one yet this independent journalist recording in a publicly accessible building is clearly and unfairly portrayed as the true threat and completely deprived of his freedom and liberty in order to achieve the county’s ultimate two goals: To abscond from liability from not only this but another legal matter (Lawsuit), and to seek a second banishment from Lafayette County to the previous recipricantt of Wild West Justice. The true motive and motivation of this political WITCHHUNT by the State of Mississippi and Lafayette County can’t and won’t be ignored and avoided. That I solemnly swear.. These are the facts the news media refused to report on when they decided to cover this story.”</p>\n<cite>Matt Reardon</cite></blockquote>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:19px\">Reardon uploaded the Audit of City Hall to YouTube the very same day, which the prosecution then used as its evidence of the crime charged. But watch the video below. Do you honestly see any type of conduct that was ever directed at Mayor Robyn Tannehill? Reardon NEVER knew for a fact that she was in the building. In fact there was never was the first piece of evidence offered that she was indeed there as was claimed. But what you do see as evidence is a complete view of every step Reardon took inside of that building. CERTAINLY nothing remotely warranting a Felony Charge 1-week later</h4>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[19][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mh96ckpwv3Y?feature=oembed\" title=\"1st Amendment Audit of Oxford, MS City Hall- DETAINED &amp; RELEASED OVER MAYOR’S 2017 RESTRAINING ORDER\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Shown above is the Full Start to Finish First Amendment Audit by Matt Reardon at the Oxford, MS City Hall on June 20, 2017.

Reardon claims Mauney intentionally ignored and suppressed other evidence that he claims is exculpatory and would show vengeful prosecution aimed at him, and a clearly biased stance by the Agency.

I arrived at the Oxford Police Department at approximately 0900 hours and met with Investigator Shane Fortner in reference to their investigation thus far. Investigator Fortner briefed me on the information that the Investigators had about the case. The suspect Matthew Oliver REARDON was under a protection order issued by the Chancery Court.</p>\n<p>I, Lieutenant Joey Mauney, reviewed the case report by Lieutenant Shane Fortner then proceeded to go to Facebook and went to Matthew Reardon’s public page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100079610670652\"> https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100079610670652</a>. I observed a link to a YouTube video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mh96ckpwv3Y\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/mh96ckpwv3Y</a>. I clicked on the link and was directed to the video on YouTube and began to watch the content. The incident involves a video is 23 minutes and 35 seconds in length. In the video, you can see Matthew Reardon walk up to the doors of City Hall and enter the building at approximately 3:53 on the video. He goes to a display board that shows where the different departments are within City Hall. He then proceeds to walk around the first-floor videotaping before returning to the display board at approximately 5 :45 on the video. Reardon then walks up the stairs to the second floor and proceeds to Mayor Tannehill’s office doors. He stands at the doors for a brief time then walks away but soon returns. At approximately 7:49 on the video, he attempts to enter the door by using the doorknob but was unsuccessful. He again walks away until he is met by someone on the second floor. He tells the female that he remembered the mayor’s office is on the first floor from when Mayor Patterson was in office.</p>\n<p>The suspect Matthew REARDON has continually violated parts of his restraining order issued to Mayor Robyn Tannehill. The suspect Matthew Oliver REARDON has done this in person as well as social media outlets like Twitter and YouTube. The suspect made tweets towards the Mayor on several different occasions to include May 23, 2021, August 3, 2021, August, 2021, August 12, 2021, August 17, 2021, August 23, 2021, and September 1, 2021 just to name a few incidents.</p>\n<p>Based on the about facts and circumstances and the heinous nature of this crime, this affidavit requests an Arrest Warrant be issued for Matthew Oliver REARDON for Stalking; Aggravated Stalking.”<br/></p>\n<p>Lt Joey Mauney</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Here are the tweets from 2021 Mauney referenced</h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[16][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Jesus help me!

A #Chilling of the Constitutional Rights of Journalists &amp; Reporters In North MS\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">My name is Matt Reardon and I am an independent investigative journalist &amp; reporter. On December 6th, 2021, I had discovered a key court record in Lafayette County Circuit Court that I fully believe was fraudulently altered. This just so happened to be the second time this has happened over the past year on two currently active filed matters of mine in Circuit Court. When pressing in for answers as to how this could have happened, the Circuit Clerk, Jeff Busby, got highly defensive and told the other clerks not to answer any of my questions and even acknowledged he had never seen or heard of this happening. </p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Busby then communicated out to the Lafayette County Sheriff Joey East in order to try to get rid of me due to the newest significant issue discovered and undoubtable issues that would come from the discovery. East’s motive in the matter is very clear to see when taking into consideration key facts based upon numerous erroneous and concerning findings have more recently surfaced regarding the Lafayette County Sheriff’s alleged involvement in a matter dating back to 2017. Even more alarming is the fact that the latest record fraudulently altered in Circuit Court that was discovered by me just so happened to be a matter I was appealing from Lafayette County Justice Court where East’s Deputies and even he himself gave false sworn testimony in order to contrive a conviction based upon lies. The very next day, December 7th, 2021, Lafayette County Sheriff Joey East rose to the occasion once again in passing obnoxious lies and complaints centered around constitutionally protected activity as a journalist, reporter, and credentialed member of the press to an employee of Communicare by the name of Rachel Alcorn with a predisposed plan to exploit the State’s mental health laws by cutting corners, ignoring required procedure under state law, and seeking to separate a husband and father of four from his family in a grueling, sickening act that undoubtedly would align with not only the feeling, but the legal definition of human trafficking. And this they were successful in doing at the expense of both me and my family when no crimes were ever committed and the entire procedure was botched through and through. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLanNSgj_Hs?feature=oembed\" title=\"These Calls go to fully invalidating Communicare and exposing their truly immoral intentions\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">At approximately 5pm on December 7th, 2021 upon returning home from a Doctors Appointment for one of his children, I was taken into custody at my residence in front of my wife and child based upon false claims in a sinister, cowardly attack on an independent journalist in order to suppress the reporting of fraud to not only the public, but the proper authorities for the dishonesty which took place on open legal matters stemming from the Lafayette County Circuit Court/Circuit Clerks Office.  </p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">After discharge from a two-and-a-half-week involuntary stay based upon lies and cover-up, I immediately condemned the ruthless attack and labeled it for what it was: a fraudulent commitment coming about as a result of completely erroneous lies spewed by the sheriff, Joey East, and completely botched procedure by Communicare and its Employees. After voicing my complete disgust with the matter to a Communicare employee, I was informed that I needed to submit any complaint in writing to the director of the Facility including any demand for preservation of evidence. Early on in the afternoon on February 8th, 2022 at the conclusion of speaking with chancery court clerk Sherry Wall, I filed and served an 8-page shocking letter with Chancery Judge Lawrence Little’s chambers and Communicare’s executive director Dr. Sandy Rogers. The very next day, February 9th, 2022, another Communicare Employee proceeded to file another affidavit for commitment of me claiming I had refused to attend a scheduled appointment, however, recorded phone calls with Communicare paint an entirely different picture and in combination with the Complaint filed just 1-day prior almost certainly show that this latest move by Communicare and its employees was ill-brought once again and done to retaliate against me and once again try to dodge a situation that the county and Communicare brought on themselves.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[7][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6inozk6x59M?feature=oembed\" title=\"Urgent Notice to take Immediate Action Given to Communicare after Fraud and Whistleblower Violations\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">On February 10th, 2022, upon returning home close to midnight from my wife being hospitalized due to pregnancy complications, Lafayette County Sheriffs Deputies light up the yard with blue lights and take me once again into custody for the affidavit for commitment filed in front of my wife, Madelyn.  I was held for 6-days without any rights afforded to me at the Lafayette County Detention Center and then shipped 2.5 hours across the state to the East Mississippi State Hospital in Meridian MS on February 16th, 2022. There I would stay, deprived of my liberty among other rights, for 30 days. All of this put Madelyn into preterm labor and she gave birth via emergency c-section on February 17, 2022 to a 2lb 11oz extremely premature baby boy without me by her side. </p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 177.77777777777777%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/530a8d197c90a62a1812297efb0ae878?preload=true&amp;poster=https%3A%2F%2Fvideodelivery.net%2F530a8d197c90a62a1812297efb0ae878%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D16s%26height%3D600\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I now take the position that this latest move constitutes violations of the false claims act along with violations of the whistleblower act, while leaving me feeling like a victim of human trafficking by county officials and a Quasi-Governmental entity, Communicare through the exploitation of Mississippi’s outdated mental health laws in a conspiracy involving local Government officials and private citizens in this latest move that I believe chills the Constitutional Rights of other citizens, particularly journalists and reporters if left unchecked.

    "title": "Loose State Laws in Mississippi Regarding Involuntary Judicial Commitment",
    "content": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">First off this article is an opinion column regarding my own personal opinions surrounding this controversial topic. I have molded my opinion off of falling clutch to involuntary judicial commitment not once, but twice at the hands of state actors and elected officials whom exploited the loopholes in Mississippi’s mental health laws and used it as a way of locking me up/fencing me in when there was no crime committed for them to have me arrested on. The laws around mental health and the requirements to judicially commit vary from state to state, however there exists strong federal case law which is geared towards preventing exactly that which happened to me more recently here in the State of Mississippi.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1975 (<em><a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/422/563.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">O’Connor v. Donaldson</a></em>) that “A State cannot constitutionally confine… a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends…”  This decision established the standard that a finding of “mental illness” alone is not enough to confine a patient against their will; they must also be either:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A <strong>danger to the public</strong> (invoking the state’s inherent police powers); or</li><li>A <strong>danger to themselves</strong> (the legal doctrine of “<a href=\"https://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/parens-patriae.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">parens patriae</a>“).</li></ul>\n<p>Civil commitment laws in most states authorize the following kinds of involuntary confinement and treatment:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong><em>Emergency Hospitalization –</em></strong> Often referred to as a “psychiatric hold,” this typically involves a limited confinement in response to a crisis for evaluation purposes.</li><li><strong><em>Inpatient Civil Commitment –</em></strong> This is a longer-term confinement, typically in effect until the court determines the patient no longer meets civil commitment criteria.</li><li><strong><em>Outpatient Civil Commitment –</em></strong> Often referred to as “mandated” or “assisted” outpatient treatment (<a href=\"https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/aot/assisted-outpatient-treatment-guide.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AOT</a>), this involves court-ordered mental health treatment while the patient continues to live in the community (a handful of states <em>haven’t</em> adopted this option, including Maryland and Massachusetts).</li></ol>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A paradox easily forms when comparing the legislature of the state (Mississippi) and the landmark ruling in O’Connor v Donaldson in which that fine line measured on a state level encroaches upon the substantive due process rights of its citizens guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The US Supreme Court was both spot on and crystal clear in their ruling when they decided that a State cannot constitutionally confine… a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. Lafayette County and the State of Mississippi  have more recently demonstrated how easy a state or local county Government can exploit mental health laws in order to attempt to fix (or stage) a more favorable outcome. Could you imagine if O’Connor vs Donaldson hadn’t of occurred or if the justices didn’t rule the way they did?? We’d all be in trouble and seemingly always be in the crosshairs of oppressive government.</p>\n<p>It’s for the reasons of what happened to me in December and again in February that I decided a couple of things in particular need to happen with a quickness, of those being:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>There is not nearly enough case law on involuntary commitment, and it is badly needed for a more uniform process across the board garnering federal approval </li><li>The laws surrounding involuntary commitment MUST be tightened up significantly, particularly in Mississippi, and the individual must meet a high, strict standard of someone whom requires mental health treatment through involuntary commitment</li><li>A watchdog agency should always oversee the involuntary commitment process to ensure no malice or ill intent causes such commitment so as not to strip and deprive a functioning American citizen of his or her liberty and other due process rights</li><li>I believe that a trial by an impartial jury should always be preserved and should always be allowed on involuntary commitment proceedings if demanded by the respondent </li></ol>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">And Last but certainly not Least, the laws and procedures surrounding involuntary judicial commitment MUST be adhered to fully by the court and any official tasked with any involved role. The worst thing anyone can do is to retaliate to any complaint by using involuntary judicial commitment, or using it in ways to suppress any type of information and basic rights of any citizen.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-385\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/loose-state-laws-on-involuntary-judicial-commitment/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-385\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-385\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-385\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/loose-state-laws-on-involuntary-judicial-commitment/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-385\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-385\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-385\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/loose-state-laws-on-involuntary-judicial-commitment/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-385\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-385\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

    "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>On March 14th we published a nearly 5-minute audiobook preview from the beginning of Matthew Reardon’s soon-to-be released book “American Injustice- One Man’s Battle Against Corruption and Retaliation”. Below is the final conclusion chapter of this book. The book will be offered in audiobook format. Digital download of an E-Book version will be free.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:40px\"></div>\n<p>My resolve to expose corruption stems from an unyielding passion for justice, forged through deeply personal experiences and an unwavering devotion to constitutional rights. I have felt firsthand the bitter sting of betrayal—framed, wrongfully accused, and targeted by those who swore an oath to uphold the very laws they trampled upon. These experiences left scars but ignited within me an unstoppable fire.</p>\n<p>My relentless pursuit to unveil the truth is not simply an effort to right the wrongs done against me; it is a broader mission to safeguard the rights and liberties of every citizen. It is a commitment to ensure that my children, and yours, inherit a society built upon integrity rather than corruption.</p>\n<p>I fight, not from a place of vengeance, but from the conviction that silence in the face of injustice amounts to complicity. This fight is my legacy, a testament to the principle that our constitutional framework must be fiercely defended against those who seek to exploit power for personal gain. It is a declaration that truth and accountability are not merely ideals but essential cornerstones of a free and just society.</p>\n<p>Justice in America is supposed to be blind. It’s supposed to be fair. But the truth is, justice in this country is bought and sold—and if you don’t have the money to afford it, you’re at the mercy of a system that will chew you up and spit you out without hesitation.</p>\n<p>Crime does not discriminate. Anyone—rich or poor, white or black, connected or forgotten—can find themselves accused of something they didn’t do. But while crime doesn’t discriminate, justice does.<br/>If you have money, you can hire a private attorney. You can post bond. You can fight.</p>\n<p>If you don’t? You’re stuck with overburdened public defenders, unaffordable bail, and a system that assumes you’re guilty the moment you step into a courtroom.</p>\n<p>That is not justice. That is oppression.</p>\n<p>The state claims that every defendant has rights. The right to an attorney. The right to a fair trial. The right to due process. But what happens when those rights are denied? What happens when a defendant is thrown in jail without a real opportunity to defend themselves? What happens when the state manipulates the system to ensure a conviction, not justice?</p>\n<p>When the government intentionally denies someone due process, any conviction, plea, or punishment that follows should be null and void. It should be looked at under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine, the same way tainted evidence is thrown out of court. If the state’s case is built on lies, fraud, and coercion, then anything they extract from that process is illegitimate.</p>\n<p>And yet, prosecutors and judges weaponize plea deals against defendants who are backed into a corner with no real choice but to sign away their rights—not because they’re guilty, but because they know the deck is stacked against them.</p>\n<p>That isn’t justice. It is legal extortion. When a person is falsely accused, arrested without cause, and then denied the basic protections of due process, the state is kidnapping them under the guise of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Think about it.</p>\n<p>Under U.S. federal law (18 U.S. Code § 1201) kidnapping is defined as:<br/><em>“Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.”</em><br/></p>\n<p>How can bail not be considered a form of ransom, particularly in a system where the individual is supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty?</p>\n<p>The bail system in America is no different. If you have the money to buy your freedom, you can walk out of jail. If you don’t? You sit in a cage. The state is literally holding people for ransom.</p>\n<p>And what about those who are jailed without bond? What about those who are forced to take plea deals just to escape their captors? What about the ones who have a family crisis involving their spouse and children and take a plea deal solely so they can get their freedom to support their family in times of need?</p>\n<p>At what point does this cross the line from wrongful imprisonment to government-sanctioned kidnapping and government-sanctioned human trafficking?</p>\n<p><br/>The prison system in this country is a multi billion-dollar industry, fueled by overcharging, forced guilty pleas, and judicial corruption. The state profits off of stolen lives and broken families—and then they have the audacity to call it justice.</p>\n<p>We’ve been taught to believe in innocent until proven guilty. But let’s be honest—that isn’t the reality. From the moment someone is accused, they are treated as guilty until proven innocent. They lose their job. They lose their home. Their reputation is destroyed before they even step foot in a courtroom.</p>\n<p>And if they can’t afford to fight? They get buried.</p>\n<p>The state doesn’t care about the truth. They care about convictions—because that’s what wins elections. That’s what funds their offices. That’s what keeps the system churning.</p>\n<p>Judges don’t care about the wrongfully accused. They care about efficiency—closing cases, processing defendants like cattle, and maintaining their unchecked power.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement doesn’t care about due process. They care about statistics—how many people they can arrest, how many charges they can file, how much money they can seize in fines and fees, and how to save their job and avoid the next lawsuit if their wrongful actions lead to the false imprisonment of an innocent citizen.</p>\n<p>We have turned the justice system into a machine that is designed not to protect the innocent, but to guarantee convictions.</p>\n<p>And I am living proof of that.</p>\n<p>The justice system in America needs a complete overhaul. We need true accountability for prosecutors, judges, and law enforcement officers who abuse their power. We need stricter protections for the accused—to ensure that no one is coerced into a plea deal, no one is held indefinitely without cause, and no one is railroaded by a system designed to break them. We need a justice system that actually delivers justice. Not to some but to all.</p>\n<p><br/>Until then, we are not a nation of laws.

The Ordinance in reference barred the use of photography or video recording inside of any City Building. However, on  October 13, 2022 all of that would come under direct challenge by a Journalist/1st Amendment Auditor/ Constitutional Rights Activist.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xn7rFwo3uYg?feature=oembed\" title=\"Loudmouth Karen gets CHALLENGED!

Later that day, he got a return call from the Mayor. In that call, matters deteriorate as both Reardon the Mayor take two completely opposite stances on the matter at hand. Reardon states that he is fully intent on constitutionally challenging the Ordinance and will return to request public records, recording video as he is doing it. Mayor Ferrell then welcomes the challenge, stating he will even personally address the matter when Reardon comes in video recording. Then both state their willingness to fight the matter in court.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[6][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NbaNCKHX1A?feature=oembed\" title=\"Batesville, MS Mayor Hal Ferrell calls the day after my 1st Amendment Audit of City Hall!\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Here is the call on 10/14/2022 between Reardon and Mayor Hal Ferrell</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On 10/17/2022, Reardon calls Mayor Ferrell back to let him know he was coming to constitutionally challenge the city Ordinance and request Public Records on Wednesday 10/19/2022 to ensure the Mayor was going to be there. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[8][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kV30BjUta_o?feature=oembed\" title=\"Calling Mayor Hal Ferrell to let him know I'll Constitutionally Challenge his Ordinance on Wednesday\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The confirmation call on 10/17/2022 from Reardon to Mayor Hal Ferrell</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On Wednesday, 10/19/2022 just after 2pm, Matt Reardon delivers on his promises and arrives at City Hall walking in with not just one camera recording video, but three separate cameras.  Mayor Hal Ferrell comes out of his office and immediately greets Reardon, shaking his hand, and stating that he and the board of Aldermen convened the night before. During this meeting they discussed all the grievances stated and took into account all the calls and emails received on the matter from a plethora of concerned citizens. Ferrell says they held a special vote and voted to repeal the Ordinance. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[10][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vi5wjrKLIMA?feature=oembed\" title=\"Meeting Batesville, MS Mayor at City Hall to Constitutionally Challenge the “NO RECORDING” Ordinance\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Since that time, Reardon says that he and the Batesville Mayor have spoken several times and that a mutual respect and friendship have been established.

    "content": "\n<p class=\"p1\">By Don Matthews | April 4, 2025</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">SALT LAKE CITY, UT — In a searing new video published to YouTube, investigative journalist and constitutional rights activist Matthew Reardon has publicly read aloud his second sworn declaration—known as Exhibit D—which alleges chilling misconduct by the FBI and paints a disturbing picture of federal retaliation against whistleblowers and journalists.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[3][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNVBPVWiHx8?feature=oembed\" title=\"EXHIBIT D: My Official Declaration Calling Out FBI Intimidation Tactics\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exhibit D</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">The declaration, dated April 1, 2025, chronicles events from just 48 hours prior—when Reardon visited the FBI Salt Lake City Field Office on March 31st in an attempt to hand-deliver his first sworn affidavit, which accused Oxford, Mississippi Police Captain Hildon Sessums of civil rights violations, unlawful surveillance, and interstate retaliation.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What followed, according to Reardon’s detailed testimony, was a coordinated attempt to silence and intimidate him. Rather than accept the affidavit, FBI agents demanded he submit to a background check—an unconstitutional requirement, Reardon says, that he flatly refused. Agents then threatened him with arrest, ordered him off federal property, and recorded his license plate as he stood in a public visitor parking lot peacefully reading from his original statement on camera. See the article at https://www.wtpnews.org/fbi-threatens-journalist/</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[6][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwMjxvSazqY?feature=oembed\" title=\"FBI Threatens Journalist with Arrest While Attempting to Report Police Corruption\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">FBI Agent Threatens Journalist With Arrest for Trespassing while other gets and openly admits he’s getting the tag number.</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">That encounter sparked the creation of Exhibit D, Reardon’s second formal declaration—this time documenting the FBI’s own conduct on March 31st. The declaration has now been entered into his federal civil rights lawsuit, submitted to multiple U.S. Senators, and sent to the DOJ Office of Inspector General.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery

happened to me,” Reardon said. “This is about a dangerous precedent—where the federal government uses intimidation and surveillance to suppress dissent, silence journalists, and shield its own from accountability.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon alleges that the FBI’s refusal to accept evidence, coupled with its treatment of him during his visit, reflects a pattern of deliberate indifference to government misconduct—particularly in cases involving former FBI Academy affiliates like Captain Sessums. The declaration also raises the possibility that the FBI may be coordinating or sharing surveillance data with Oxford PD, who Reardon is suing in a high-stakes federal case filed last week in Utah.

reading his second sworn declaration in its entirety, word for word, laying out accusations of First and Fourth Amendment violations, retaliatory surveillance, and systemic abuse of power.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The public reading marks a significant moment in Reardon’s escalating campaign to expose what he calls a multi-state conspiracy aimed at derailing the upcoming release of his non-fiction exposé, American Injustice, which details the corruption and abuse he’s personally witnessed across Mississippi and beyond.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon has now:</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">• Filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Oxford, MS and Layton, UT officials;</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">• Submitted sworn declarations to the court and DOJ;</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">• Filed complaints with the ACLU, EFF, and Mississippi POST; </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"

You get the case of Captain Hildon Sessums—a disgrace in uniform and a walking constitutional violation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On February 5, 2025, Captain Sessums, a high-ranking officer with the Oxford Police Department, used his official email account to send a smear-laced message targeting journalist and constitutional rights activist Matthew Reardon. The email wasn’t a lawful warning, nor was it part of an investigation. It was a retaliatory act—a political hit job masquerading as inter-agency communication.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sessums’ target? A First Amendment auditor who had lawfully recorded a public location in Layton, Utah. A journalist who dared to point a camera at power and exercise his rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His weapon? A badge, a keyboard, and unrestricted access to law enforcement databases.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The result? A chilling abuse of power.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doxed-by-government-surveillance\"><strong>Doxed by Government Surveillance</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">What sets this apart from a routine abuse of discretion is the level of precision involved. The address included in Sessums’ email wasn’t public. In fact, Reardon had only been living at his new Layton, Utah address for not even four days. He hadn’t filed a lease. He hadn’t changed his mailing info. He hadn’t submitted it to any agency or utility.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Yet somehow, Sessums had it. And he shared it freely.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">That email, dripping with defamatory language and personal bias, labeled Reardon a “persistent issue” and went on to highlighted Reardon as a convicted felon which in the language of “copsplaining”, conveys that person is an active threat and should get different treatment.

It sparked a domino effect.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Shortly after receiving it, Lieutenant Riley Richins of the Layton Police Department blasted Reardon’s private information to approximately 100 Law Enforcement officers. The mass email included his full name, date of birth, private address, and a deceptive narrative claiming he was charged and convicted of Stalking the Oxford Mayor in 2017—something even court records don’t support.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15827 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"15827\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"dedede\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image-2\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-231x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[15][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.avif\" data-orig-size=\"790,1024\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/image-2/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.avif 790w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-231x300.avif 231w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x995.avif 768w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #dedede;\" width=\"790\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Look how many email addresses this email was sent to!</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15826 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"15826\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"c7c7c7\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-739x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-216x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[15][self::DIV]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[1][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1152,1597\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/image-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-739x1024.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-739x1024.avif 739w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-216x300.avif 216w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-768x1065.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-1108x1536.avif 1108w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.avif 1152w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #c7c7c7;\" width=\"739\"/></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p3\">This is more than a communications breakdown. It’s an orchestrated character assassination—fueled by illegal surveillance, jurisdictional overreach, and a total disregard for constitutional protections.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fighting-back-complaints-filed-receipts-loaded\"><strong>Fighting Back: Complaints Filed, Receipts Loaded</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon isn’t backing down. He’s going scorched earth—filing formal complaints with:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The Mississippi Ethics Commission</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) board</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I didn’t just file complaints, I armed them with the kind of proof that forces doors open and burns bullshit to the ground.  Each submission is a demand for justice, accountability, and systemic change.” said Reardon.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-broader-pattern-oxford-police-department-amp-lafayette-county-sheriff-s-department\"><strong>The Broader Pattern: Oxford Police Department &amp; Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">This isn’t a one-off scandal. Sessums’ actions mirror the broader culture of corruption that’s been festering in Lafayette County for years. The Oxford Police Department, like its counterpart the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department, has turned public service into personal vendettas. They’ve weaponized surveillance tech, misused public databases, and targeted critics with chilling precision.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They don’t want accountability—they want silence. And they’re willing to break laws to get it.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-is-the-line-in-the-sand\"><strong>This Is the Line in the Sand</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p3\">What Sessums and his collaborators did wasn’t a mistake. It was deliberate. It was malicious. And now, it’s public.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“This video is my response—raw, unfiltered, and constitutionally protected. No threats. Just truth. I’m not backing down. I’m invoking my rights, and this is what calling out power really sounds like,” said Reardon.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“This isn’t just about one dirty cop. It’s about a system that protects itself at the expense of the people it swore to serve.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Stand up- because when they come for one of us, they’re coming for all of us</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Watch.

Sessums, a graduate of the FBI National Academy, has been linked to a multi-state effort to target Reardon following his public criticism and reporting on government abuse.</p>\n<p>Prior to accepting the affidavit, FBI agents demanded that Reardon submit to a full background check — a condition he refused on Fourth Amendment grounds. Agents then ordered him off the property, threatening arrest for trespassing while he peacefully read his statement from the public visitor parking lot.</p>\n<p>“This is a blatant violation of the First and Fourth Amendments,” said Reardon. “No victim of a crime should be forced to undergo a search just to report misconduct. That’s not law enforcement — it’s institutional retaliation.”</p>\n<p>The encounter has been documented in a formal declaration now submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Inspector General and will be sent to Senators Mike Lee and Mitt Romney in a request for Congressional inquiry.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

This is not just a legal battle—it’s a direct confrontation with the institutional rot festering beneath the badge.</p>\n<p>The complaint, grounded in <strong>42 U.S.C. § 1983</strong> and <strong>42 U.S.C. § 1985</strong>, exposes a coordinated act of <strong>retaliation, illegal surveillance, defamation, and abuse of interstate law enforcement infrastructure</strong>—all triggered by my work as a <strong>journalist</strong>, an <strong>author with an upcoming book release</strong>, and <strong>constitutional rights activist</strong>.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/reardon-v-layton-oxford-et-al-filed-address-redacted.pdf\"><img alt=\"Reardon v Layton et al 1st page\" class=\"wp-image-15893 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"15893\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"f3f3f3\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Reardon v Layton et al 1st page\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-801x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-235x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[3][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1244,1590\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/img_3990-1-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1590\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1.avif 1244w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-235x300.avif 235w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-801x1024.avif 801w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-768x982.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_3990-1-1-1202x1536.avif 1202w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #f3f3f3;\" width=\"1244\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click on image to view entire filed complaint</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-setup-retaliation-across-state-lines\">The Setup: Retaliation Across State Lines</h2>\n<p>On February 1, 2025, I moved quietly to Layton, Utah. I didn’t share my new address. I didn’t update government records. Hell—I didn’t even have it memorized. But just <strong>four days later</strong>, Captain <strong>Hildon Sessums</strong> of the <strong>Oxford Police Department (MS)</strong> emailed my full address to Lieutenant <strong>Riley Richins</strong> of the <strong>Layton Police Department</strong>, labeling me a “persistent issue” and making false claims about my past.</p>\n<p>That address was not in any government database. So how did Sessums get it?</p>\n<p><strong>He couldn’t have.</strong> Not legally. Not honestly. Not without surveillance.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15819 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"15819\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"f4f4f5\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"untitled-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-792x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-232x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[8][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1546,2000\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/untitled-1-4/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-792x1024.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-792x1024.avif 792w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-232x300.avif 232w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-768x994.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3-1187x1536.avif 1187w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/untitled-1-3.avif 1546w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #f4f4f5;\" width=\"792\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">In his email, Sessums references a “First Amendment Audit” I conducted which can be viewed below</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[10][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4Q0HrVybEM?feature=oembed\" title=\"JUST RELEASED: 911 Call &amp; Bodycam Footage from Zions Bank Silent Audit!

It’s about sending a message: <strong>you don’t get to weaponize the badge to silence the press.</strong> You don’t get to lie, smear, and surveil citizens because they made you uncomfortable.

The call, placed by journalist and activist Matthew Reardon to the Oxford Police Department, escalates into a blistering confrontation with Police Chief Jeff McCutchen—a man Reardon alleges helped orchestrate years of unlawful persecution.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And every second of that call was recorded.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Missing Man in Blue: Captain Sessums</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The call begins with Reardon demanding to speak with Captain Hildon Sessums, a man who has become a central figure in what Reardon asserts is a multiyear campaign of targeted harassment. Sessums, however, is once again “unavailable.” Receptionists and staff stumble to explain his whereabouts, even as Reardon tears into what he calls a blatant misuse of city time and resources. “Where’s this guy at?” Reardon asks. “He’s probably expending city resources running illegal surveillance.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By the time Police Chief Jeff McCutchen enters the call, the gloves are off.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Illegal Surveillance Across State Lines</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon, who now resides in Utah, accuses Sessums and the Oxford Police Department of acquiring and disseminating his private address within days of his move—before signing a lease and without disclosing the location to anyone. “Nobody had my address. I didn’t even know my fucking address,” he said. “But he did.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This, Reardon alleges, is damning proof of illegal surveillance and data collection by OPD. He’s since filed complaints with the Department of Justice, Mississippi POST, the ACLU, and is preparing further civil rights actions.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Pattern and Practice Argument</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon invokes the “pattern and practice” clause—a legal doctrine used by the DOJ to dismantle corrupt departments—accusing OPD leadership of weaponizing state resources against him for constitutionally protected activity, including public records requests and peaceful demonstrations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re wiping your ass with the Constitution,” he tells McCutchen. “Your qualified immunity will not survive this.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gaslighting in Real-Time</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rather than address the core allegations, Chief McCutchen pivots. “Do you have somebody you can talk to?” he asks, implying mental instability. Reardon responds with fury: “Of course, here comes the gaslighting. I have every fucking reason to be furious.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This moment lays bare a classic law enforcement defense: discredit the accuser, dismiss the message.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Reardon isn’t rattled.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A History of Retaliation</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">The call revisits Reardon’s 2017 arrest—a time when, he asserts, false narratives and absent documentation were weaponized to destroy his life. He outlines how his wife lost her job, how he missed critical months with his hospitalized son, and how OPD fabricated a stalking charge during his family’s darkest hour.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“They ambushed me on the square,” he says. “Why the fuck is there not a police report for May 26, 2017?”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">McCutchen’s Response: A Masterclass in Evasion</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Throughout the call, McCutchen neither confirms nor denies the allegations. He offers no commitment to investigate. He shows no concern over the breach of privacy or taxpayer misuse. When asked directly if he will open an internal inquiry, his answer is damning in its apathy: “I don’t work for you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But he does. His salary is publicly funded.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fallout Has Only Begun</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">This recorded confrontation is just the beginning. Reardon is not only escalating complaints to federal agencies—he’s publishing the evidence for the world to hear and judge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His site, <a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org\">WTPnews.org</a> hosts the audio, the documentation, and will soon carry the lawsuits, affidavits, and formal complaints. “This isn’t personal,” Reardon says. “This is systemic. And I’m going to burn it down, brick by unconstitutional brick.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>The fire has been lit.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">#CivilRights #SurveillanceState #OxfordPD #MississippiCorruption #WeThePeople #FirstAmendment #IllegalSurveillance #PoliceAccountability</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-15858\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15858\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/calling-oxford-police-a-raw-recorded-reckoning-with-injustice/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-15858\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-15858\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-15858\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/calling-oxford-police-a-raw-recorded-reckoning-with-injustice/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-15858\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-15858\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-15858\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/calling-oxford-police-a-raw-recorded-reckoning-with-injustice/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-15858\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-15858\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

    "title": "FBI Tried to Intimidate Me—So I Turned the Camera on Them",
    "content": "\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Salt Lake City, Utah</em></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">On Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in a bold act of protest and accountability, I returned to the same FBI Salt Lake City field office that just days ago refused to accept my sworn federal declaration regarding government misconduct and threatened me with arrest—and this time, I brought the camera. Several actually.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[3][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\nhttps://youtu.be/GP1cmJfvRZ4?si=YQO9r2Ozzo7B8n5I\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why? Because after filing a formal whistleblower complaint to the DOJ’s Office of Inspector General—alleging illegal surveillance, data misuse, and retaliation—I was met with silence, threats, and tracking. The FBI refused to accept my declaration. They threatened to arrest me. They took down my license plate. All of this coming after my private address was leaked to the hands of a police captain 1,700 miles away—information I hadn’t shared with anyone and hadn’t submitted to any business or agency.   In fact I didn’t even have the address memorized as I had just moved in. Then my address along with other false and defamatory statements was disseminated out to 139 law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That’s not oversight. That’s complicity. And it’s criminal.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So on Tuesday 4/15/2025, I fought fire with fire.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I set up cameras outside the FBI’s secure exit gate and began filming.

In fact, it was a brand-new, updated filing that incorporated additional declarations and evidence stemming from a previous OIG complaint submitted in early 2025—which also went completely unacknowledged.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[7][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNw7cdu_ugM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Justice Denied?

Ignored by the OIG</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This isn’t negligence. This is institutional stonewalling,” Reardon declared. “The OIG was given hard evidence—sworn statements, supporting documentation, and a full timeline implicating DOJ-connected actors in surveillance and retaliation. And yet, I’ve received no case number, no confirmation of receipt, not even a single email response.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to Reardon, the complaint includes proof that protected federal data may have been unlawfully shared with local police in multiple jurisdictions, including in Utah and Mississippi. The results: doxxing, targeted enforcement actions, and a chilling effect on protected press activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The core allegations involve:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• Improper use of federal surveillance databases (such as NCIC, CJIS, or NLETS)</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• Retaliation for lawful journalistic activity, including silent audits and public records investigations</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• Cross-jurisdictional coordination between federal and local officials aimed at discrediting and silencing a journalist</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On April 10, the day after the formal complaint was submitted, Reardon followed up with a second email—again, no response. Today, Reardon placed a direct call to the OIG’s public contact line, navigated the phone prompts to reach a live agent, and was sent to voicemail. Despite leaving a detailed message requesting a same-day response, there was no return call or follow-up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is the Department of Justice’s internal watchdog,” Reardon said. “If this is how they treat whistleblower complaints from a journalist with documented constitutional violations, then how many other legitimate complaints are getting buried? Who else are they protecting?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The implications go far beyond one individual’s case. Reardon says this silence from the OIG undermines public trust in government accountability mechanisms and raises serious concerns about institutional complicity.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“Their job is to investigate misconduct. Instead, they’re helping to conceal it. That makes the OIG part of the problem, not the solution,” Reardon added.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon has now escalated the matter, preparing certified mail packets to the DOJ OIG, filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to uncover any internal handling of his complaint, and notifying Judicial Watch, the ACLU, and Congressional oversight bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A formal press release and supporting documentation will be made public in the coming days. Reardon says the evidence is extensive and disturbing—and he won’t rest until it’s heard.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If the government refuses to act, the people will,” he concluded. “This is what the First Amendment was made for. And I intend to use it.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16155 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"16155\" data-comments-opened=\"1\"

The evidence not only debunks allegations that Reardon was a threat, but it also reveals that Rhea Tannehill himself made a documented threat of extreme physical violence against Reardon in the courthouse on May 30, 2017—an allegation that was conveniently omitted from the Tannehills’ legal filings.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">With no police evidence supporting the restraining order, and multiple proven falsehoods in the petition, the case raises serious legal and constitutional concerns about the misuse of judicial power to silence a political critic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Police Reports Contradict the Restraining Order’s Claims</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">A public records request confirmed that only three police reports exist involving Reardon in May 2017, the same month the restraining order was issued. None of them provide any evidence that Reardon was dangerous, nor do they support the Tannehills’ claims of threats or harassment.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>1. May 5, 2017 – Reardon Was the One Threatened</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• <a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3481-1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reardon filed a police report</a> stating that a woman named Nicki Preuitt posted on Facebook that she would punch him in the mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• There was no report of Reardon threatening anyone.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>2. May 13, 2017 – No Evidence of Threatening Texts to Terry Warren</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• The restraining order falsely claims that Reardon sent threatening texts to Terry Warren.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• However, the <a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3482-1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the police report</a> classifies the incident as “harassing text messages”, not threats.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• This is a critical contradiction, proving that the restraining order contained a falsehood to justify its issuance.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>3. May 25, 2017 – Reardon Lawfully Exercising His Rights</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Reardon was observed walking near the Lafayette County Courthouse carrying a flag and firearms.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• <a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3483-1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The police report</a> explicitly states that Reardon was not acting as a threat.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• This directly contradicts #18 in the petition for the restraining order, which states that numerous people contacted the Oxford Police Department to report that Reardon was dangerous.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• In reality, no police report from May 2017 describes Reardon as dangerous.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rhea Tannehill’s Documented Threat Against Reardon</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Perhaps the most damning revelation from these reports is that Rhea Tannehill himself threatened extreme physical violence against Reardon on May 30, 2017, in the hallway outside the courtroom.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3336-1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office report</a>, after the restraining order hearing, Reardon and Rhea Tannehill encountered each other in the hallway. Reardon called out Tannehill for lying, to which Tannehill attempted to rush at Reardon while holding a water bottle, yelling that he would “bash [Reardon’s] head in.”</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">“I then stepped in front of Rhea and told him to leave,” the reporting officer stated.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Despite clear documentation of Tannehill threatening violence, no restraining order was issued against him. Meanwhile, Reardon was portrayed as a threat in the court filing—despite no police report supporting that claim.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Restraining Order Used as a Prior Restraint on Speech</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">The police report from May 30, 2017, also proves that the restraining order was used to silence Reardon from speaking at Oxford City Hall.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Judge Glenn Alderson extended the restraining order after Rhea Tannehill informed him that Reardon was scheduled to speak at a City Hall meeting on June 6, 2017—the same day Robyn Tannehill was elected mayor.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Alderson specifically instructed law enforcement that if Reardon showed up to speak, he was to be arrested.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• This is a textbook example of unconstitutional prior restraint, where the government uses legal means to prevent someone from speaking publicly.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">“The timing and intent behind this restraining order are now clear,” Reardon stated. “It was never about protecting anyone. It was about silencing me at a critical political moment.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proven Falsehoods in the Restraining Order</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">These police reports completely discredit multiple claims in the restraining order petition:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Claim: Reardon sent “threatening texts” to Terry Warren.</p>\n<p class=\"p6\">• Fact: The police report classifies the incident as “harassing text messages,” not threats.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Claim: “Numerous people” contacted Oxford Police to report that Reardon was dangerous.</p>\n<p class=\"p6\">• Fact: Only three reports exist for May 2017, and not one describes Reardon as dangerous.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Claim: The restraining order was necessary for protection.</p>\n<p class=\"p6\">• Fact: Rhea Tannehill, not Reardon, made a documented violent threat, yet no action was taken against him.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Legal and Political Implications</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p3\">This new evidence raises serious legal and constitutional concerns:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Did the Tannehills knowingly submit false information to obtain a restraining order?</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Did Judge Alderson violate Reardon’s First Amendment rights by extending the order under political pressure?</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Was the restraining order used as a tool of political retaliation rather than a legitimate legal safeguard?</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/new-york-times-co-v-united-states/#:~:text=Often%20referred%20to%20as%20the,prior%20restraint%20by%20the%20government.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that prior restraints on speech are unconstitutional unless an extreme threat exists.</a> The police reports show that no such threat ever existed. (New York Times Co. v. United States (1971))</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Case of Judicial Corruption?</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p3\">With documented falsehoods in the restraining order petition, evidence of a physical threat made against Reardon, and a clear violation of First Amendment rights, this case raises the possibility of judicial corruption in Lafayette County.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As Reardon continues to investigate, this case could become a landmark example of how judicial power can be abused for political and personal agendas.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>For now, the question remains:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">Was this restraining order a legal safeguard, or was it a blatant act of judicial corruption designed to silence a political critic?</p>\n<figure

The case, involving Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill and her husband, Rhea Tannehill, raises serious questions about judicial discretion, procedural compliance, and potential conflicts of interest within Lafayette County’s legal system.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">At the heart of the controversy is the apparent absence of a security deposit or bond, a requirement under <a href=\"https://casetext.com/rule/mississippi-court-rules/mississippi-rules-of-civil-procedure/chapter-viii-provisional-and-final-remedies-and-special-proceedings/rule-65-injunctions#:~:text=Rule%2065%20authorizes%20parties%20to,other%20relief%20is%20being%20sought.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 65 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure</a> when a restraining order is issued. Reardon, in his call to Judge Little’s office, sought to determine whether any record existed of a bond being posted. Tara, the judge’s law clerk, asserted that the matter was handled by a previous judge and was no longer open to appeal.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9b9U4EMrUlU?feature=oembed\" title=\"Incredible Facts come to light in this call to the Judge’s Chamber- Insolence of Lafayette County\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Legal Dispute Over Bond Requirement</h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Rule 65 states that a security deposit or bond is required to protect the enjoined party if the injunction is later found to be wrongful. However, the court may determine an appropriate sum at its discretion. Reardon contends that while discretion exists, it must be documented in the record. His search of Mississippi Electronic Courts (MEC) revealed no such documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“The rule actually says ‘in such sum as the court deems proper,’ so that means it’s discretionary to the court,” Tara stated.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon, however, rebutted this interpretation:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“The court is allowed discretion to a certain extent, but there must be something in writing to that effect. To just give somebody a free pass and it not be documented or written would be fundamentally unfair.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The lack of documentation raises further concerns given that the petitioner, Robyn Tannehill, is a prominent public official. Reardon questioned whether political influence played a role in the handling of the case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Allegations of Fraud and Misrepresentation</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon’s skepticism about the restraining order’s legitimacy extends beyond procedural errors. According to him, the allegations contained in the 2017 petition were based on falsehoods, misrepresentations, and constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The restraining order petition, now reviewed as part of this investigation, cites alleged threats and harassment from Reardon. However, Reardon claims that subsequent law enforcement records prove that he was not the aggressor and, in fact, was the one threatened.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“I have obtained law enforcement reports showing that the petitioner (Rhea) actually threatened harm on me,” Reardon stated. “Yet I was the one who was restrained—without a bond, without due process, and based on lies.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Further, Reardon pointed out that some claims in the restraining order involve speech that should have been protected under the First Amendment. The vague and broad language used in the petition raises concerns about whether the order was improperly granted based on constitutionally protected expression.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Judicial Bias and Lafayette County’s Handling of the Case</h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">Beyond the specifics of the restraining order, Reardon believes his case highlights a broader pattern of judicial bias in Lafayette County, where he alleges officials have repeatedly disregarded due process when he is involved.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“Is this a common practice—that whenever it comes to anything against me, Lafayette County officials immediately get complacent and deflect? … Anything illegal can happen to me, and things are allowed to go by unchecked and unchallenged, no matter how wrong or illegal they are?” Reardon asked during the call.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Tara denied any impropriety and suggested that if Reardon believed he had grounds for relief, he should pursue them through formal legal motions rather than a phone call.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“There is a proper way to present matters to the court, and a telephone call is not that way,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon, however, argued that previous efforts to seek relief through official channels had been ignored or dismissed without proper review, reinforcing his belief that local officials were more interested in covering up past mistakes than ensuring justice.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Case That Demands Scrutiny</h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">The 2017 restraining order against Reardon was signed by Judge Alderson, who later retired. The timing of the case, coupled with the absence of a documented bond and the involvement of high-profile local figures, raises significant questions about transparency and fairness in Lafayette County’s judicial process.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While the restraining order remains in place, Reardon’s investigation and continued pursuit of legal accountability suggest that this case is far from over. Whether through legal action or public exposure, he appears determined to bring attention to what he sees as a serious miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For now, the question remains:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Was this restraining order a legitimate legal action, or was it a case of judicial favoritism for Oxford’s first family? I believe the facts and evidence now make this an obsolete question</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tannehill-restraining-order.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15645\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[27][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3474-1-785x1024.jpg?resize=785%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"785\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click on the image to view the petition for the restraining order filed May 22, 2017.</figcaption></figure>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-414\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/judicial-oversight-questioned/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-414\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-414\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-414\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/judicial-oversight-questioned/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-414\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-414\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-414\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/judicial-oversight-questioned/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-414\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-414\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

    "title": "The Silence of Injustice: How the DOJ is Shielding Corruption by Design",
    "content": "\n<p class=\"p1\">By Matthew Reardon | We The People News</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the Department of Justice becomes complicit in silence, it ceases to be a guardian of justice and becomes an architect of oppression.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Over the past year alone, I have submitted multiple formal complaints to the DOJ Office of the Inspector General, each one detailing glaring civil rights violations, due process breaches, and retaliatory actions by law enforcement at both the local and federal level. These aren’t abstract allegations. They are concrete, timestamped, documented episodes of unconstitutional behavior—backed by records, court filings, audio recordings, and first-hand testimony.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNw7cdu_ugM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Justice Denied? FBI Silence on IG Complaint &amp; False Testimony Leads to Prison\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">DOJ IG Complaint Ignored: FBI Silence &amp; Sheriff Deputy’s Lies Led to a Year in Prison</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yet the DOJ has responded with the most telling reaction of all: nothing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">The February Complaint That Vanished Into the Void</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">On February 29, 2025, I submitted a formal Inspector General complaint detailing how Mississippi law enforcement—including deputies from Lafayette County—abused the legal system to retaliate against me for my constitutionally protected journalism. The centerpiece of that complaint was my 2022 arrest and imprisonment for simply notifying authorities of a planned visit to the FBI office to report corruption—something I had every legal and ethical right to do. That visit was used as a pretext to revoke my probation. I served a full year behind bars for it. The FBI, who was informed of this in real time, said nothing.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[8][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNw7cdu_ugM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Justice Denied?

I requested a response, a case number, and an investigation. Months later—there has been no acknowledgment, no case number, no follow-up.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">The April 2025 Complaint: History Repeats Itself</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then came April 9, 2025. Another IG complaint—this time spotlighting a second wave of misconduct, including Oxford Police Department’s covert sharing of my private Utah address with Layton Police mere hours after I relocated across the country. The DOJ received this, along with documents showing a clear trail of unlawful surveillance, data misuse, and an orchestrated campaign to discredit, dox, and intimidate me across state lines.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Again—radio silence.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">This Isn’t Negligence. It’s Policy.</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">The refusal to act isn’t bureaucratic backlog. It’s institutional pattern. It is part of a broader practice at the highest levels of the Department of Justice to avoid confronting internal rot—especially when that rot involves retaliatory misconduct by federal partners, state prosecutors, or police departments operating under color of law.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Let me be clear: I am not the only one this has happened to. But I may be one of the few who has documented every step, every filing, every denial.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From Lafayette County to Galveston, Texas, to Layton, Utah—I have now traced a continuum of misconduct across jurisdictions. Every time I escalate it, the DOJ’s response is predictably absent. When a journalist is jailed for reporting, silenced through commitment schemes, doxxed after moving states, and retaliated against through federal silence—that is not an oversight. It is collusion by inaction.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[17][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QIeZkGaVQ4?feature=oembed\" title=\"Whistleblower SHUT OUT by DOJ Watchdog — Inspector General Refuses to Acknowledge Complaint!\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Whistleblower SHUT OUT by DOJ Watchdog — Inspector General Refuses to Acknowledge Complaint!</figcaption></figure>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">A Dangerous Precedent for the Republic</h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the DOJ’s Inspector General can receive a complaint with overwhelming evidence—when that office can verify serious misconduct and choose to do nothing—we are no longer dealing with a flawed system. We are confronting a weaponized silence designed to protect power, not the people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law. But where is the equal protection when the DOJ selectively shields corruption? When the Constitution is treated as a technicality instead of a foundation?</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Time for Accountability, Not Apologies</h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">This article is more than a warning. It is a line in the sand. I am calling for:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• A formal Congressional inquiry into the DOJ OIG’s failure to respond to public complaints.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• Immediate release of all case files, response logs, and internal communications regarding complaints submitted under my name from 2022 to 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">• Public transparency into how and why DOJ complaints are routinely dismissed or ignored when involving law enforcement misconduct.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The people deserve answers. The Constitution demands action. And history will not be kind to those who looked the other way while civil liberties were crushed under the weight of bureaucratic indifference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Contact:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Matthew Reardon</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Investigative Journalist | We The People News</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Email: <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"a3ced1c6c2d1c7cccde3d4d7d3cdc6d4d08dccd1c4\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Website: <a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org\">www.wtpnews.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-16221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16221\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/silence-of-injustice/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-16221\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-16221\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-16221\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/silence-of-injustice/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-16221\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-16221\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-16221\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/silence-of-injustice/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-16221\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-16221\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

It is not a misdemeanor. It is not a disorderly conduct charge waiting to happen. It is, unequivocally and unshakably, protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">In America, the right to criticize government, express dissent, and speak freely — even in vulgar terms — is more than a privilege. It is the bedrock of liberty. And yet, far too often, law enforcement and government officials attempt to twist the use of profanity into a criminal act. They rely on intimidation, vague “harassment” laws, or even threats of arrest to muzzle speech they personally dislike.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Let me be blunt: that is unconstitutional. Period.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">THE SUPREME COURT SPOKE. YOU DON’T GET TO CENSOR.</h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">The U.S. Supreme Court made this crystal clear over 50 years ago in Cohen v. California (1971), when a young man was arrested for wearing a jacket in a courthouse that read: “Fuck the Draft.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Justice Harlan wrote the majority opinion, affirming:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“One man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“The constitutional right of free expression is powerful enough to protect the vulgar expression of ideas — even those which offend.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">That landmark case didn’t just protect Cohen. It protected all of us — every protestor, every journalist, every citizen who dares to say something unpopular, abrasive, or passionate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WORDS CAN BE STRONG — BUT THEY AREN’T CRIMES.</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">To this day, people are wrongfully threatened with arrest or charged under bogus laws like “disorderly conduct,” “harassing communications,” or “breach of peace” — all because they dared to use strong language in the presence of a government employee.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But as the courts have repeatedly held: unless you are making a true threat or inciting imminent lawless action, your speech — vulgar or not — is constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Profanity is not cause for arrest. It is not probable cause. It is not “disorder.” It is expression.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE LAW ROUNDUP:</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">• Cohen v. California (1971): “Fuck the Draft” jacket = protected speech.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">• Houston v. Hill (1987): Verbal challenges to police, even angry ones, are not illegal.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">• Duran v. City of Douglas (1990): Man flips off and curses at cops — court finds this was protected speech.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">• Lewis v. City of New Orleans (1974): Struck down a law criminalizing verbal abuse of police.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">• State v. Smith (Utah App. 2004): Angry voicemails full of vulgarity = not harassment under the law.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The First Amendment doesn’t give way to government discomfort. It wasn’t written to protect polite conversation — it was written to protect unpopular speech in the face of unaccountable power.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF POWER</h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">Here’s the hypocrisy: police officers and public officials can scream, curse, and intimidate — and no one bats an eye. But the moment a citizen uses the same language to express outrage at injustice or government abuse, they’re suddenly labeled a “threat,” a “harasser,” or worse — a criminal.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">That’s not justice. That’s tyranny disguised in uniform.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When government agents try to criminalize language, they’re not enforcing the law — they’re violating it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WE DON’T NEED CENSORSHIP — WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY.</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">The real danger isn’t the word “fuck.” The real danger is a system that fears that word more than it fears:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Police corruption</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Illegal surveillance</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Qualified immunity</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">• Retaliation against journalists and activists</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">If you’re more offended by a four-letter word than you are by abuse of power, you’ve lost the plot.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROFANITY ISN’T THE PROBLEM. OPPRESSION IS.</h6>\n<p class=\"p3\">At We The People News, we will continue to speak the truth — in plain English. Sometimes that means uncomfortable words. Always, it means uncompromising honesty.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">So the next time someone in power threatens you with arrest for saying “fuck,” “shit,” or “bitch” — remember: you have a right to say it. And we have a duty to defend that right.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Because if they can criminalize your words today, they’ll criminalize your beliefs tomorrow.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">And that’s the real obscenity. I’ve got your fucking back</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-16240\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16240\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/saying-fuck-shit-or-bitch-is-not-a-crime-its-protected-speech-under-the-first-amendment/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-16240\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-16240\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-16240\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/saying-fuck-shit-or-bitch-is-not-a-crime-its-protected-speech-under-the-first-amendment/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-16240\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-16240\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-16240\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/saying-fuck-shit-or-bitch-is-not-a-crime-its-protected-speech-under-the-first-amendment/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-16240\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-16240\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

Reardon stated to the police that he had not consumed a drop of alcohol over the last 3 to 4 years’ time when asked to step out of the vehicle and conduct a field sobriety test. He stated that the field sobriety test has been notorious for being rigged and proceeded to demand a breathalyzer test be administered to prove that he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages. Reardon, a First Amendment Auditor and constitutional rights activist, was recording this encounter along with two friends adjacent to the stop. Galveston police insist on the field sobriety test, which Reardon refuses, demands an attorney, and again demands a breathalyzer test be administered. </p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Reardon is then placed under arrest for suspicion of DWI, loaded into the back of a truck, and brought to the hospital for a blood test to be administered. The department refused to administer a breathalyzer as demanded, despite the probable cause remaining that the odor of alcohol was the motivating force. The officers proceeded to a blood draw, claiming that a warrant was being applied for to obtain the blood sample. Without being shown any warrant, Reardon is forcibly held down by nearly 10 officers while handcuffed behind his back and then stuck with a needle multiple times in his right arm. </p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After all of this Reardon is brought to the Galveston County jail. While in booking, Reardon hears the arresting officer on a phone call with deputy Kandi Beavers with the Lafayette County Mississippi sheriff’s department where she allegedly conspires with the officer to book Reardon for felony DUI third, despite a highly controversial DUI from February 2021 involving Deputy Beavers. Reardon insists the particular 2021 DUI is currently on appeal after crucial evidence proving Reardon’s innocence on that particular DUI came up missing at his November, 2021 trial. Reardon has also strongly asserted that Deputy Beavers committed perjury by lying on stand and under oath in order to send Reardon off to prison for one year in 2022, a claim he says should not only Brady-List Beavers and terminate her employment as a law enforcement officer, but also criminally indict her based upon credible evidence that has been brought forth and asserted. Reardon claims that this attempt to jail him in Galveston, Texas for felony DUI, based upon false allegations made is an outrageous attempt to re-imprison him through using Galveston, TX to do Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department’s bidding. Particularly that of Deputy Kandi Beavers based upon the serious allegations Reardon has brought to the surface about the Deputy’s knowingly false, retaliatory claims made. <strong><em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1ZQb_0YWmxU?si=GZ9JrCG64_9jlXUl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A video detailing out these claims on Beavers can be viewed here</a></em></strong></p>\n<p>Watch the video above of the controversial DWI Arrest on 8/11/2023.

It all starts with Reardon filing his appeal of Justice Court Convictions in Lafayette County Circuit Court with the Circuit Clerks Office.  Upon receiving everything, Deputy Circuit Clerk Chyna Sinervo informed Reardon that his assigned judge in a new matter filed in this North Mississippi Circuit Court would be Judge Kent Smith, and that the judges are assigned via an algorithm that randomly (and presumptively fairly) assigns a circuit court judge to a newly filed case out of the three Circuit Court Judges available. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[9][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dHJbVAJGk98?feature=oembed\" title=\"Filing new case in Lafayette County Circuit Court challenging Justice Court Case w/ Notice of Appeal\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Reardon is shown simply trying to find out where the responsibility falls when the Judge in his newest court filing is mysteriously changed to the same Circuit Court Judge (Luther) Reardon claims presents a gigantic conflict of interest, even citing certain individual violations of the Judicial code of ethics, the high standard all judges are held to. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[11][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtQojMeiISI?start=96&amp;feature=oembed\" title=\"Asking about Court Record being changed for 2nd time in a year 12-6-2021\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">After walking out of the Circuit Court Courthouse, Reardon mildly states his state of shock and concern at how quickly the situation deteriorated. Outside, Reardon is then confronted by Lafayette County Sheriff Joey East who tells Reardon to not go back into Circuit Court unless he has something in specific to file. At this point, Reardon takes the opportunity to get a few things off of his chest regarding the flagrant uncaring abuse of what he states is his constitutional rights and civil duty, even referencing to the Lafayette County Sheriff’s requests as being “tyrannical”. A few other pleasantries are exchanged before Reardon leaves in disarray at what had just transpired.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[13][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVuKdCSBsCg?feature=oembed\" title=\"Sheriff Joey East pulls up and tells me not to go back into Circuit Court/Clerks Office on 12/6/2021\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:32px\"></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">After an unsuccessful call to Judge Luther and Judge Smith’s Offices, Reardon receives a call from Circuit Court advising him that his newest court filing was improperly filed in circuit court and would need to be refiled in Justice Court which Reardon rushes to do in just the nick of time. The very next day, December 7th, 2021, Lafayette County Sheriff Joey East rose to the occasion once again in passing obnoxious lies and complaints centered around constitutionally protected activity as a journalist, reporter, and credentialed member of the press to an employee of Communicare by the name of Rachel Alcorn with a predisposed plan to exploit the State’s mental health laws by cutting corners, ignoring required procedure under state law, and seeking to separate a husband and father of four from his family. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[16][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4cfRLA9fJg?feature=oembed\" title=\"Reardon Taken into Custody on a mental writ by Communicare December 7th, 2021\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">SHOWN ABOVE: Reardon is seen arriving home with his family when two Lafayette County Sheriff’s Deputies pull up advising Reardon that a “Writ to take Custody for Mental Commitment” had been taken out for him earlier that day, and he is then taken into custody.</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:16px\">This they were successful in doing at the expense of both Reardon and his family when no crimes were ever committed, and the entire procedure was botched through and through. On 12/30/2021 It was made known that Local Law Enforcement tying directly to the Lafayette County Sheriff Joey East had tendered the obnoxious, damning lies to Rachel Alcorn, an employee of Communicare, in a successful attempt to get Communicare to seek Judicial Commitment of Matt Reardon, in a grueling, sickening act that undoubtedly would align with the legal definition of human trafficking.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[18][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tofQF-i-neU?feature=oembed\" title=\"Communicare Employee Rachel Alcorn admits to info passed by East and Lafayette County Sheriffs Dept\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The call December 30, 2021 with Communicare employee Rachel Alcorn</figcaption></figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:32px\"></div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14093\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[20][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/img_2221.jpg?fit=1024%2C1461&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">East’s motive in the matter is very clear to see when taking into consideration key facts based upon numerous erroneous and concerning findings have more recently surfaced regarding the Lafayette County Sheriff’s alleged involvement in a matter dating back to 2017. Even more alarming is the fact that the latest record fraudulently altered in Circuit Court that was discovered by me just so happened to be a matter I was appealing from Lafayette County Justice Court where East’s Deputies and even he himself gave false sworn testimony in order to contrive a conviction based upon lies. Reardon immediately condemned the latest ruthless attack and labeled it for what it was: a fraudulent commitment coming about as a result of completely erroneous lies spewed by the sheriff, Joey East, and completely botched procedure by Communicare and its Employees.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">After voicing his complete disgust with the matter to a Communicare employee, Reardon was informed that he needed to submit any complaint in writing to the director of the Facility including any demand for preservation of evidence. Early on in the afternoon on February 8th, 2022 at the conclusion of speaking with chancery court clerk Sherry Wall, Reardon filed and served an 8-page shocking letter with Chancery Judge Lawrence Little’s chambers and Communicare’s executive director Dr. Sandy Rogers.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[23][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6inozk6x59M?start=424&amp;feature=oembed\" title=\"Urgent Notice to take Immediate Action Given to Communicare after Fraud and Whistleblower Violations\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">The very next day, February 9th, 2022, another Communicare Employee (Susan Beard) proceeded to file another affidavit for commitment of Reardon claiming he had refused to attend a scheduled appointment, however, recorded phone calls with Communicare paint an entirely different picture and in combination with the Complaint filed just 1-day prior almost certainly show that this latest move by Communicare and its employees was ill-brought once again and done to retaliate against Reardon and once again try to dodge a situation that the county and Communicare brought on themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\" style=\"font-size:18px\">On February 10th, 2022, upon returning home close to midnight from his wife being hospitalized due to pregnancy complications, Lafayette County Sheriffs Deputies light up the yard with blue lights and take Reardon once again into custody for the affidavit for commitment filed in front of his wife, Madelyn. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[26][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIi076YiK8E?feature=oembed\" title='Matt Reardon Committed for 2nd time in 2 months time over \"missed appointment\".

There he would stay, deprived of his liberty among other rights, for 30 days. All of this put Madelyn into preterm labor and she gave birth via emergency c-section on February 17, 2022 to a 2lb 11oz extremely premature baby boy without her husband by her side.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">Reardon now takes the position that this latest move constitutes violations of the false claims act along with violations of the whistleblower act, while leaving him feeling like a victim of human trafficking by county officials and a Quasi-Governmental entity, Communicare through the exploitation of Mississippi’s outdated mental health laws in a conspiracy involving local Government officials and private citizens in this latest move that he fully believes chills the Constitutional Rights of other citizens, particularly journalists and reporters if left unchecked. Particularly when these individuals could be poised to pull this very bold move again on him, or anyone else whom holds any information disfavoring to them.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:18px\">Matt Reardon claims these acts of aggression demonstrate acts of insurrection committed by the Lafayette County Sheriff through a massive abuse of power, and that everything that has occurred since 2017 calls for investigation and prosecution under the Patriot Act and the RICO Act. He alleges All of this amounts to a Completely Low-Blow, Conspired upon Attack organized and orchestrated by Lafayette County Officials to intimidate and remove not only a private citizen, but a credentialed Journalist/Reporter not once but twice within 2 months time; on December 7, 2021 and February 10th, 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:15px\"><b><i>NOT ONLY WAS THIS A MASSIVE, INTENTIONAL ATTACK ON HIS CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES, BUT THAT THIS WAS AN UNSCRUPULOUS ATTACK ON A CONCERNED CITIZEN DOUBLING AS AN INDEPENDENT REPORTER BY THE SAME GOVERNMENT ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHANGED COURT RECORDS.

All of this because he disapproved of the journalist’s email address — a bold expression of political speech aimed at police corruption.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The email in question? <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670112040c08170327081f010815030812130b06104904080a\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"0a6c7f6961657a6e4a65726c65786e657f7e666b7d24696567\">[email protected]</span></a> — a First-Amendment-protected statement of criticism directed at the Oxford Police Department.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16250 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"16250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"e6e6e7\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_4640-2-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-1024x614.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-300x180.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[3][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1256,753\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/img_4640-2-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"614\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-1024x614.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-1024x614.avif 1024w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-300x180.avif 300w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-768x460.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-1080x647.avif 1080w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-980x588.avif 980w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1-480x288.avif 480w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4640-2-1.avif 1256w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #e6e6e7;\" width=\"1024\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a documented exchange between Busby and civil rights journalist Matthew Reardon, Busby flatly declared:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I will not respond to this email address in the future.” says Lafayette County Circuit Clerk Jeff Busby in a blatant act of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16248 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"16248\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"ececed\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_4641-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-1024x638.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-300x187.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[6][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1240,772\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/img_4641-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"638\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-1024x638.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-1024x638.avif 1024w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-300x187.avif 300w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-768x478.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-400x250.avif 400w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-1080x672.avif 1080w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-980x610.avif 980w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1-480x299.avif 480w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4641-1.avif 1240w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #ececed;\" width=\"1024\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">That single sentence may carry explosive legal consequences. Under settled Supreme Court precedent, government officials may not condition access to public services on agreement with the speaker’s viewpoint. Doing so is not only unconstitutional — it’s the very definition of government overreach.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“This wasn’t about obscenity or threats. This was about one thing — retaliating against a journalist for daring to criticize a public agency,” said Reardon in a follow-up interview. “They want to make speech the issue instead of their misconduct.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16251 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"16251\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"e3e3e4\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_4639-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-810x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-237x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[9][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1209,1528\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/img_4639-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-810x1024.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-810x1024.avif 810w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-237x300.avif 237w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-768x971.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-1080x1365.avif 1080w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-980x1239.avif 980w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1-480x607.avif 480w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_4639-1.avif 1209w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #e3e3e4;\" width=\"810\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The refusal came just hours after Reardon made multiple formal calls to the Lafayette County Circuit Clerk’s office requesting his Clerk’s Papers — official documents necessary for his appeal before the Mississippi Supreme Court. Despite providing his case number and request in compliance with state rules, his request was ignored, rerouted, and ultimately denied. Shown below is the call Reardon made to the Lafayette County Circuit Clerks Office the day before, 4/21/2025.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[11][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K0PJ4zgu4c?feature=oembed\" title=\"CIRCUIT CLERK JEFF BUSBY IS GOING TO GET TRIGGERED OVER THIS ONE! 🤣🤣🤣🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🖕🖕🖕\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Pattern of Retaliation</h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">This latest incident marks yet another flashpoint in Reardon’s escalating legal battle with Mississippi authorities. After years of exposing corruption, recording public officials, and challenging unconstitutional actions in court, Reardon has become a frequent target of state and local retaliation.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Earlier in the day, Deputy Circuit Clerk Chyna Sinervo also refused to send the requested court records, stating on a recorded line:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“It’s just not professional. We’re not going to send it to that email.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[16][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-tbU-Vqjss?feature=oembed\" title=\"I knew exactly how they would respond. #AccessDenied #ViewPointDiscrimination\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">Constitutional scholars say that’s not just improper — it’s illegal.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“When government officials deny service or access to records because they dislike a speaker’s message, that is the textbook definition of viewpoint discrimination,” said a First Amendment legal expert familiar with the case. “It’s the most egregious form of censorship.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Constitution Doesn’t Care If You’re Offended</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">The U.S. Supreme Court settled this issue more than 50 years ago in Cohen v. California (1971), where a man was arrested for wearing a jacket that said “Fuck the Draft” in a courthouse. The Court overturned the conviction, stating:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“One man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fast forward to 2025: it’s not a jacket this time — it’s an email address.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“The Constitution doesn’t care if you’re offended,” said Reardon. “What matters is whether the government gets to pick and choose whose voice matters. And today, in Lafayette County, they chose censorship.”</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Stakes: A Court of Law, or a Court of Politics?</h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon’s request wasn’t abstract. The Clerk’s Papers he sought are required to finalize his appeal — an appeal already hanging by a thread due to missed deadlines and systemic stonewalling. By refusing to respond, officials are interfering with his access to justice.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“You can’t weaponize access to the courts,” Reardon said. “You can’t deny someone the ability to fight for their freedom because you don’t like their tone or their politics.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fight Ahead</h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">Reardon is now preparing to file a supplemental federal complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging First and Fourteenth Amendment violations. He is also filing formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the Mississippi Ethics Commission, and multiple national press freedom watchdogs. He says this isn’t the first time Busby has far exceeded his authority in violating the first amendment.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[29][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kt0tqavhQI?feature=oembed\" title=\"Jeff Busby has been a First Amendment hating tyrant for a long time.

    "content": "\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">On June 20th 2022, I decided to do a first amendment audit of Oxford Mississippi City Hall with a goal of requesting public records from the city clerk at the conclusion. These audits were something I had started doing as a citizen journalist to promote government transparency and accountability, and I had done several during the month of June. As I’m doing my audit documenting the inside of City hall, I am approached by Oxford police lieutenant Kevin Parker and ordered out of the building under detainment due to Parker stating mayor Robyn Tannehill had a restraining order for 2017 which was still allegedly active against me. Another supervisor, Captain Lyons, then approaches me, and I voice my disagreeance with all of this calling it unconstitutional to bar a citizen and journalist from City Hall based upon a five year old extremely shady restraining order taken out never renewed by a mayor whom I never asked for, and never saw while I was in City hall. Lyons says if I come back to City Hall I would be arrested for trespassing and violation of restraining order. I complied and I left.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[2][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mh96ckpwv3Y?feature=oembed\" title=\"1st Amendment Audit of Oxford, MS City Hall- DETAINED &amp; RELEASED OVER MAYOR’S 2017 RESTRAINING ORDER\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">On June 28th 2022 as I was walking into Lafayette county chancery Court for a child custody hearing I’m wandered by Major Alan Wilburn of the sheriff’s department and told I can’t come in with the recording devices per the judge. he then pulls out an arrest warrant for the charge of aggravated stocking which stem directly from me walking in the city hall on June 24th to do a first amendment audit. What I would later find out was that the Oxford police chief Jeff McCutchen had referred the matter which should have been squashed over to the Mississippi bureau of investigations and returned they felony charge of aggravated stocking citing the audit and five to six Twitter tweets against Tannehills policies one year prior during her reelection campaign as the course of conduct supposedly directed at Tannehill. I was given a $10,000 Bond set my Judge Kent Smith which was promptly moved to be revoked by assistant district attorney Tiffany kilpatrick. at the preliminary and revocation of bond hearing which gave the impression of the kangaroo court, judge Smith ruled that I be held without bond in order to mental health exam and competency hearing. my initially assigned public defender Mitchell Driskill was mysteriously replaced with another attorney by the name of Mark McClinton and was from New albany. However there was never any Court filing or entry authorizing the swap. what if what I quickly found out was that McClinton did not have my best interest at heart whatsoever. Not only could I rarely reach him, but the court ordered mental health exam wasn’t scheduled by him until nearly two months later, in September. Dr Christopher Lott conducted the mental health exam and concluded that I had no bipolar or any other major or noticeable mental health illness. The day before the competency hearing September 29th, I speak with McClinton on the phone he informs me the whole case fell apart from the state, they never had anything on me to begin with as the charge didn’t fit, and the following day the charge would be tossed completely at the competency hearing on September 30th. This never happened just following day McClinton springs a guilty plea on me telling me if I don’t take it, the jury would be tainted and fixed and the elements of the charge would be exploited likely sending me to prison, even if it moved to another adjacent county. He said if I accepted it, I’d go home in my family today, and get five years probation, banishment from Lafayette county for five years beginning 45 days later, and that he would expunge the charge when eligible. Due to a crisis with my family I felt my hands were tied and I took the Guilty plea, solely to get out take care of my family. I immediately told the McClinton this was a mistake and I wanted to withdraw my plea and go to trial. He wouldn’t entertainment he wouldn’t entertain it or assist with it so on October 31st 2022 I filed my own motion to withdraw guilty plea and either go to trial or dismiss the unconstitutional charge. </p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">A few days prior, I witnessed an act of police corruption in a neighboring City and captured it on video. I reported this to the local FBI field office in Oxford Mississippi on October 28th 2022. I was advised to bring the video up to the field office a short time later and I recorded this call. I then called to Lafayette county sheriff’s office to report my requested presents at the FBI office in Oxford so as to being compliance with the circuit court order regarding the banishment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-tropicalista-pdfembed\" data-apikey=\"28781d535506472c9c32c08eae87840d\" data-dockpagecontrols=\"true\" data-embedmode=\"\" data-enableformfilling=\"true\" data-filename=\"revocation\" data-mediaurl=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/revocation.pdf\" data-showannotationtools=\"true\" data-showdownloadpdf=\"true\" data-showfullscreen=\"true\" data-showpagecontrols=\"true\" data-showprintpdf=\"true\" id=\"db0cf982-c9d6-4f42-a458-3c5ccd0c7e86\" style=\"height:500px\"></div>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">On November 1st 2022,  the day after I filed my motion to withdraw my guilty plea, the assistant district attorney filed a motion to revoke my sentence and hold me without bond for a revocation hearing, which is then ordered by judge Tollison. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[7][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8Sb1QkK9dY?feature=oembed\" title=\"Call and trip to FBI 10/28/22 goes  from lies and bullshit to entrapment and false imprisonment\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">I was arrested the evening of November 1st 2022 and held in jail until November 3rd for the revocation hearing.

It Ended in Prison.</h2>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">On June 20, 2022 I walked into Oxford, MS City Hall with a camera in hand and a simple mission—document government officials in a public building and request records from the City Clerk. It was a standard First Amendment audit, something I had been doing all month to expose corruption and promote transparency.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I never expected that within months, I would be sitting in a Mississippi prison, stripped of my freedom, betrayed by the justice system, and silenced by the very government I sought to hold accountable.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I was about to step into a nightmare—one that would prove just how far officials would go to destroy a journalist who dared to challenge their power.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:18px\">The Trap is Set: An Old Restraining Order Resurfaces</h4>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">As I filmed inside City Hall, Oxford Police Lieutenant Kevin Parker confronted me.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“You’re detained. You have to leave,” he ordered.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">His reasoning? Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill had a restraining order against me from 2017. A restraining order taken out just two weeks prior to Election Day in 2017 for claims that can now be 100% debunked and shown to be completely false. But that’s not a story for this article.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">There was just one problem—I had never seen, spoken to, or contacted Mayor Tannehill that day. In fact, I wasn’t even aware the order still existed, let alone that it could be used to ban a citizen journalist from City Hall. Particularly when one of the big reasons I was here was to make a public records request with the city clerk.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Then came Captain Lyons. He doubled down:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">“If you come back, you’ll be arrested for trespassing and violating the restraining order.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I had two choices: leave quietly or get locked up. So, I left. But I wasn’t done.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen referred the matter—one that most legal experts argue should have been dismissed—to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations (MBI) on June 23, 2022. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The result was a felony charge of aggravated stalking against me, citing not only my First Amendment audit at Oxford City Hall but also five to six critical tweets about Mayor Robyn Tannehill’s policies during her re-election campaign a year prior. That’s right—they weaponized my tweets and a 5-10 minute video inside City Hall to put me in a jail cell.</p>\n<p>Eight days later, on June 28, 2022, Reardon walked into Lafayette County Chancery Court for a child custody hearing. Before he could enter, Reardon was met by Major Alan Wilburn of the sheriff’s department.“You can’t bring recording devices in,” he said. Then, without missing a beat, he pulled out an arrest warrant. The Charge: Aggravated Stalking.The charge stemmed from Reardon’s City Hall visit eight days earlier. But that wasn’t all. A stalking charge requires there be a “course of conduct”. This is a crucial element of the crime stalking and without this, there no crime of stalking.</p>\n<p>A “course of conduct” is legally defined in the context of stalking under Mississippi Code § 97-3-107 (and this is what I was charged with). It refers to a pattern of behavior consisting of two or more actions over a period of time, however brief, that demonstrate a continuity of purpose. This pattern must be such that it would cause a reasonable person to fear for their own safety, the safety of another, or fear damage or destruction of their property.  </p>\n<p>When MBI Lieutenant Joey Mauney wrote in his Criminal Affidavit each of the 6 twitter tweets more than a year prior as “heinous” and manifesting fear throughout Lafayette County, he was ultimately claiming that this handful of tweets I posted criticizing Tannehill’s policies and leadership constituted the “course of conduct” needed to charge me with not only stalking but aggravated stalking when there was never any contact nor did I ever want to have any contact with mayor Robyn Tannehill.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Following the MBI’s recommendation, Judge Kent Smith initially set my bond at $10,000, but this was swiftly challenged by Assistant District Attorney Tiffany Kilpatrick, who moved for its revocation. During what some observers described as a “kangaroo court” proceeding, Judge Smith ruled that I be held without bond and ordered a mental health evaluation and competency hearing.</p>\n<p>This was a particularly difficult time as I had a 4-month-old son in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at LeBonheur Hospital in Memphis, TN, and had three other children at home.</p>\n<p>At the hearing, Judge Smith played his part in this kangaroo court.“You’re being held without bond pending a mental health exam,” he ruled. Suddenly, I wasn’t just a journalist facing a bogus felony—I was being labeled mentally unstable to justify keeping me behind bars.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adding to the irregularities of the case, Reardon’s originally assigned public defender, Mitchell Driskill, was suddenly replaced by Mark McClinton of New Albany, with no formal court filing or documented authorization for the swap. Reardon soon discovered that McClinton was unresponsive and did not appear to have his best interests in mind. The court-ordered mental health exam was delayed for nearly two months, not taking place until September.</p>\n<p>There was no official court filing authorizing the change. And soon, I discovered why.McClinton wasn’t on my side.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Christopher Lott ultimately conducted the evaluation and determined that Reardon did not suffer from bipolar disorder or any other significant mental health condition. Despite this finding, the legal proceedings continued under questionable circumstances.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On September 29, 2022, the day before his scheduled competency hearing, I spoke with my attorney, Mark McClinton, who informed me that the case had “fallen apart” for the state. According to McClinton, prosecutors had no solid evidence against me, as the charge of aggravated stalking did not meet the legal criteria. McClinton assured me that the charge would be dismissed the next day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, on September 30, 2022, rather than seeing the case thrown out as promised, McClinton unexpectedly presented me with a guilty plea deal. McClinton warned me that if I refused to accept the plea, the jury would likely be “tainted and fixed,” and the prosecution would exploit technicalities to secure a conviction—even if the trial was moved to a different county.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The plea agreement stipulated five years of probation, banishment from Lafayette County for five years, and an assurance from McClinton that the charge would be expunged when eligible. Facing a family crisis and under immense pressure, I felt I had no choice but to accept the plea deal in order to secure my release.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Immediately after entering the guilty plea, I told McClinton that I had made a mistake and wanted to withdraw it to proceed to trial. McClinton refused to entertain the request or provide assistance. With no legal support from my assigned attorney, I took matters into my own hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On October 31, 2022, I filed a formal motion to withdraw my guilty plea, requesting either a trial or dismissal of what I asserted and still assert was an unconstitutional charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I took the deal. I walked out of jail. But the moment I did, I knew I had made a mistake. I immediately stated I wanted to withdraw that bogus plea. I had to, there was no other way. When McClinton wouldn’t answer my calls, I filed my own motion October 31, 2022 so as to be prompt and at 30 days.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading p3\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Retaliation: The FBI Call That Sent Me to Prison</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Three days before I filed to withdraw my plea, I witnessed a case of police corruption in a neighboring city and called the Oxford FBI field office. I also told the agent that my rights had been heavily violated by Lafayette County and needed to speak with the FBI about them as well. </p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">I was told they didn’t do appointments but twe had discussed me bringing the evidence in 1-2 hours later due to the fact that I needed to call and report my presence to the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department to be in compliance with the banishment. In following the rules, I called the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office to report my planned visit—to comply with my probation terms. I spoke with Kandace Beavers and conveyed everything correctly. This is evidenced by call recordings with both the FBI and Beavers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">But the very next day—November 1, 2022—Assistant DA Tiffany Kilpatrick filed a motion to revoke my sentence. That night, Sheriff’s Deputy Hoby James arrested me. What I would quickly find out was that Kandace Beavers intentional lies led to this, and that Hoby James was a snake in disguise. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Final Blow: A Show Trial Without Evidence</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">At the revocation hearing on November 3rd, I was blindsided.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">I wasn’t told what I was being revoked for until I was in the courtroom.</li>\n<li>I had no lawyer.  I wasn’t allowed to present evidence proving my innocence.  Sheriff’s Deputy Kandis Beavers falsely testified that I had driven to the FBI office without an appointment. I tried to speak—</li>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">“I have recorded calls proving the FBI told me to come in!”</li>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Judge Tollison didn’t care. He refused to hear my evidence.  After a short deliberation, he sentenced me to one year in prison.  For what? For obeying the law. Let’s call this what it is:</li>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">A coordinated effort to remove a government critic.</li>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">A rigged legal system that manufactures charges.</li>\n<li>A court that suppresses evidence and denies basic rights.  </li>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">I was framed, coerced, and silenced. And if they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone. The question now isn’t just <strong>how </strong>this happened.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I was given a 1-Year Prison Sentence for this madness! Throughout all of this the FBI has stayed silent refusing to come forward and admit that I did exactly as I was told and didn’t do a thing wrong here!</h5>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/d7c974f2-eeee-4a4d-8f29-4bb3aa0f5f43/audio\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen to a Podcast on this Event</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">See below the call recordings for a complaint now filed with the Office of The Inspector General</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[42][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iH1bkfzavs?feature=oembed\" title=\"Tyrants Must Be Exposed – Watch This Corrupt Deputy Caught LYING in court! #Exposed #caughtlying\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Here is the evidence they did not want to hit the surface:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/phone_20221028-103728__16622341713_80071973339141.amr_.m4a\"></audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Call to fbi on 10/28/2022</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio aligncenter\"><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/phone_20221028-104121_6622346421_80137791992918.amr_.mp3\"></audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">CALL TO LAFAYETTE COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPT AND BEAVERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER CALL TO FBI</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio aligncenter\"><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/phone9520221028-1048149595166223464219580344808838047.amr_.mp3\"></audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">cALL BACK FROM KANDACE BEAVERS </figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/phone_20221028-110006__16622346421_80593513191337.amr_.mp3\"></audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">cALL BACK FROM BEAVERS AGAIN</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/phone_20221028-144637_6622346421_5194960099058.amr-2.mp3\"></audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">CALL TO BEAVERS ABOUT GETTING STOOD UP AT FBI AND NEEDING TO GO TO US ATTORNEYS OFFICE</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\">MAJOR COMPLAINT FILED WITH OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL!

Despite ample evidence of gross civil rights violations and the Circuit court’s January 21, 2025 ruling that vacated my prison sentence, The Oxford Eagle has deliberately refused to report this critical update.

It is weaponized omission.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The public depends on journalists to report facts—not just the ones that confirm a preexisting narrative. When a newspaper intentionally buries exculpatory information that contradicts its earlier reporting, it transforms from watchdog to accomplice. The Oxford Eagle’s refusal to inform its readers of a lawful vacatur issued by the court is a dereliction of duty and a direct affront to the principles of press integrity.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Let us be clear: this was not an oversight. The Oxford Eagle was provided with ample documentation, legal orders, and a formal request for correction. They declined to acknowledge it. That choice exposes a dangerous editorial bias that casts doubt on every article they’ve published—not just about me, but about any person who finds themselves at odds with the local establishment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To their editors, it seems that truth is optional, and propaganda is policy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This isn’t just about one man’s story. It’s about systemic injustice. The Eagle’s failure to publish a court-verified reversal of a conviction signals to every citizen that if the truth doesn’t suit the powerful, it may never be told. When the press protects power instead of the people, we no longer have a free press—we have state-sponsored suppression.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a Marine Corps veteran and a constitutional rights activist, I took an oath to defend this nation from enemies both foreign and domestic. When the institutions designed to check government overreach become complicit in that overreach, it is not only my right to speak out—it is my duty.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Oxford Eagle has had every opportunity to restore credibility. Instead, they have doubled down on silence. That silence now serves as damning evidence of their ethical decay.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To the citizens of Lafayette County and beyond: You deserve better. You deserve a press that doesn’t just follow power but questions it. You deserve the truth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And to The Oxford Eagle—if you won’t report the truth, We The People will.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Editor’s Note: All court records verifying the vacated sentence are available upon request. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This article is part of an ongoing investigative series by We The People News entitled “Silence of Injustice: How Local Media Colludes with Corruption.” And trust me, there is more of it than you can imagine!</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-16435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16435\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/oxford-eagle-exposed/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-16435\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-16435\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-16435\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/oxford-eagle-exposed/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-16435\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-16435\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-16435\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/oxford-eagle-exposed/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-16435\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-16435\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

What began as a traffic stop had in a very quick time turned into a DWI Investigation, with an arrest of me made on suspicion of DWI. Here is what is so bizarre. I was not under the influence of ANY substance or alcohol! I had touched neither.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">From the moment the officers made contact, it was clear this was not a standard traffic stop. Galveston police claimed to smell alcohol coming from my vehicle. I immediately denied consuming any alcohol, stating I had not had a single drop in over 3 to 4 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Then they asked me to step out of my vehicle and perform  a field sobriety test. I refused, explaining that these tests are notoriously rigged. Instead, I demanded a breathalyzer test—the most reliable, scientific way to prove my sobriety.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">As a First Amendment Auditor, a Journalist, and a constitutional rights activist, I was recording the entire encounter. Two other journalists were also filming from a nearby location.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Despite my repeated demands for a breathalyzer, Galveston police insisted on a field sobriety test. Again, I refused, demanded an attorney, and reiterated my request for a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Instead of following standard procedure, the officers arrested me for suspicion of DWI, loaded me into the back of a truck, and transported me to the hospital for a blood test.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Even though they claimed the odor of alcohol was their probable cause, they refused to administer the breathalyzer test I repeatedly requested. Instead, they proceeded with a forcible blood draw, stating that they were applying for a warrant to take my blood sample.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">However, I was never shown any warrant. Instead, nearly 10 officers forcibly restrained me while I was handcuffed behind my back. They stabbed my right arm multiple times with a needle in a forced blood draw—without any proof of intoxication or lawful justification.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">This was brutal, unconstitutional, and illegal.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Afterward, they transported me to the Galveston County Jail.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Conspiracy Against Me</span></h2>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">While I was in booking, I overheard my arresting officer on a phone call with Deputy Kandi Beavers of the Lafayette County, Mississippi Sheriff’s Department.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I listened as Deputy Beavers allegedly conspired with the officer to charge me with a felony DUI third offense—despite the highly controversial nature of a previous 2021 DUI case involving her.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">That 2021 DUI is still under appeal, as crucial evidence proving my innocence was “conveniently” lost before my November 2021 trial. <strong><em><a href=\"https://courts.ms.gov/index.php?cn=98285#dispArea\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK THIS LINK to view my Appeal in MS Court of Appeals</a></em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">For years, I have maintained that Deputy Beavers perjured herself on the stand, lying under oath to wrongfully convict me and send me to prison for a year in 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">So, when I was released from prison on August 1, 2023,  I did exactly what anyone who has been wrongfully convicted and incarcerated due to someone else’s lies should do: I exposed her.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">I released a video on August 2, 2023 proving that Kandace Beavers intentionally lied under oath in court, which resulted in my wrongful imprisonment for a year.  This video can be seen by <a data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZQb_0YWmxU\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZQb_0YWmxU\">clicking here</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">And for that, she retaliated.

At most, it could have been a misdemeanor, but this was never about the law—it was about silencing me.  This was a deliberate, targeted attack to try and put me back in prison by using Galveston law enforcement to do Lafayette County’s dirty work.  Lafayette County needed me charged with a felony charge so they could revoke my probation and give me a much longer sentence than they could if I had been charged with a misdemeanor.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lets examine Galveston Police Officer William Osteen</span></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Now, let’s talk about Officer William Osteen—the corrupt Galveston Police officer who arrested me on August 11, 2023.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Officer Osteen’s bodycam footage shows one of the very first questions Officer Osteen asks Defendant is “You an auditor man?” (Ex. E, 02:48). </p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">He then tells another officer “Hey, I’m doing this one, this is an auditor.” (Ex. E, 03:04-03:06).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">After having less than a minute of conversation with Defendant, Officer Osteen later discusses with Officer Larry Murph how they can go ahead and arrest Defendant, stating he “can go off of slurred speech and the smell . . .” (Ex. E, 07:56-07:59).  This clearly demonstrates Officer Osteen had already decided to arrest Defendant after less than a minute of interacting with him, before having made any significant observations. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">Osteen claimed I was “Walking: Heavy Footed.” However, all video evidence shows the Defendant walking and standing normally. Officer Osteen had virtually no opportunity to observe Defendant’s walking prior to arresting him and obtaining the Warrant. (Ex. E, 09:44-12:38). The bodycam footage shows that Officer Osteen wasn’t even facing the Defendant for the brief period of time that Defendant was walking. (Ex. E, 09:44-10:11). Also, “heavy-footed” typically denotes slow, laborious movements,<br/>but Osteen would later testify that Defendant was “extremely jittery.” (Ex. D, pg. 23, ln. 25).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">In his Affidavit, Osteen claimed “Odor of Alcoholic Beverage on breath: Moderate.” The Toxicology Report revealed no trace of alcohol in Defendant’s blood. (Ex. B, pg. 1). “Moderate” is the second highest level of odor, and would not be present for a defendant with no alcohol in his system. Further, Officer Osteen clarified multiple times on camera that he did not smell alcohol on Defendant’s breath, only from his vehicle. (See, e.g., “Osteen Bodycam 1,” Ex. E, 09:35-09:39; “Osteen Bodycam 2,” Ex. F, 05:55-06:10). He would later testify under oath that once Defendant stepped out of his vehicle, he could not detect an odor of alcohol emitting from the Defendant. (Ex. D, pg. 24, lns. 1-5). Yet he still marked that there was a moderate smell of alcohol on Defendant’s breath in the Affidavit, an observation Officer Osteen had already demonstrated that he knew to be false.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Additionally in his affidavit for a blood warrant, Osteen marked “Refused to provide a sample.” Defendant clearly offered to take a breathalyzer test prior to being taken into custody, and consented to be taken into custody for that purpose. (Ex. E, 10:30-12:10). Officer Osteen had no probable cause to arrest Defendant at the point he took Defendant into custody, having smelled no alcohol nor observed any symptoms of intoxication, as described above. Officer Osteen would later testify that he did not suspect a substance other than alcohol, except that Defendant demonstrated a willingness to take a breathalyzer. (Ex. D, pg. 24, Lns. 11-21). However, being willing to take a breathalyzer is not a sign of intoxication which would justify a blood warrant, and Officer Osteen recorded only his alleged observations regarding alcohol consumption in the Affidavit. Officer Osteen intentionally omitted Defendant’s willingness to take a breathalyzer from the Affidavit so that he could use Defendant’s “refusal” as evidence supporting the Warrant.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Officer Osteen would later testify at the probation revocation hearing that Defendant’s “pupils were very small” and “he had pinpoint pupils” (Ex. D, pg. 24, ln. 10, &amp; pg. 35, ln. 7). This is the exact opposite of the dilated pupils described in the Affidavit. Officer Osteen either did not get a good look at Defendant’s eyes and was just making something up in the Affidavit—a reckless disregard for the truth—or he changed his story and perjured himself once he discovered that the Toxicology Report revealed no trace of alcohol in Defendant’s blood.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Between the time of the Affidavit and the time of the probation revocation hearing, Officer Osteen changed the symptoms he claims to have observed from alcohol (slow, thick-tongued, slurred speech; dilated pupils; smell of alcohol on breath) to another substance instead (fast speech; small pupils; jittery movements). Each observation was made under oath, but they obviously aren’t both true. Such a fundamental shift in observations, under oath, suggests intentional misrepresentation rather than innocent mistake.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>And here’s the real kicker:</strong>  Osteen <strong><em>perjured</em></strong> himself <strong><em>twice</em></strong> in my probation revocation hearing, <strong><em>falsely testifying that my toxicology report showed alcohol in my system.</em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\"> This is critical because without these false statements, there was no probable cause for my arrest.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\"><strong>Officer Osteen made these materially false or misleading statements knowingly and<br/>intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, in an attempt to set me up.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">If you scroll to the bottom of my case docket, you’ll see that on February 25, 2025, my attorney, Ben Campagna, filed a motion for a Franks hearing.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/motion-for-franks-hearing.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15412\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[44][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lafayettems.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3216-1-779x1024.jpg?resize=779%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"779\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click on document to view the entire motion </figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Is a Franks Hearing?</span></h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-size:16px\">A Franks Hearing (based on Franks v.

I will ensure that the attorneys for each of these cases receives every last piece of evidence and an unconditional guarantee by me to be deposed and testify as a witness.

Independent journalist and constitutional rights activist Matthew Reardon, widely known by his alias Don Matthews, was physically assaulted, threatened with arrest, and aggressively chased off a public sidewalk by a Mississippi State Trooper while live-streaming a peaceful protest on July 3rd, 2025.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[3][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SiQNPW2Ikd4?feature=oembed\" title=\"Journalist ASSAULTED by Mississippi Highway Patrol at the Governor’s Mansion!\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Watch as Journalist/Activist Matthew Reardon gets Assaulted by Mississippi Highway Patrol</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The protest, coined “National Fuck the Governor Day,” was aimed at calling out Governor Tate Reeves for his controversial signing of several new laws, including one that imposes a $25-per-day permit fee on homeless individuals for panhandling—a move Reardon and many constitutional scholars have condemned as a direct violation of First Amendment protections.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“Panhandling has been ruled protected speech by the U.S. Supreme Court,” Reardon said during the livestream. “But this governor wants to criminalize poverty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-caught-on-camera-the-assault\">Caught on Camera: The Assault</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">During the livestream, which drew nearly 74,000 live viewers, a uniformed state trooper can be seen storming out from the mansion gates, screaming at Reardon to leave, despite Reardon standing on a clearly public sidewalk. When Reardon refused to move—invoking his constitutional rights—the officer charged at him, knocked his phone off its gimbal, and stepped on it, according to video evidence.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“Do you know what the First Amendment is?” Reardon shouted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“I don’t give a fuck about the First Amendment,” the trooper yelled, which was captured on video.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moments later, Reardon demanded the officer’s name and badge number, calling for a supervisor while continuing to film. The footage shows escalating aggression, including verbal threats, state troopers running Reardon’s license plate, and one officer reportedly whispering through a window, “We got your tag.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-chilling-pattern-of-retaliation\">A Chilling Pattern of Retaliation</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon’s protest was more than symbolic. He alleges that Governor Reeves personally signed off on fraudulent extradition paperwork that led to his illegal transfer from Texas to Mississippi in 2024, costing him nearly a year of freedom. The documents, according to Reardon, cited fictitious case numbers and fake drug charges he was never accused of.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“They said I was a fugitive from Mississippi at the same time I was being arrested in Galveston, Texas,” Reardon explained. “It’s a legal impossibility—and they knew it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adding fuel to the fire, the documentation used to justify his extradition was “certified” under Mississippi law using bogus annex papers, allegedly rubber-stamped by both Governor Reeves and Secretary of State Michael Watson.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-demand-for-accountability\">Demand for Accountability  </h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">After the assault, Reardon demanded to file an on-site complaint. When the supervisor arrived, however, the response was chillingly familiar: “We’ll handle it internally.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“That’s code for ‘Nothing will happen,’” Reardon stated. “This is exactly why people are losing trust in the justice system. These officers violate rights, and then they close ranks and protect each other.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Multiple civil rights organizations have since expressed interest in the case.

He wasn’t yelling. He wasn’t trespassing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">He was holding a camera on a tripod.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But by the end of the hour, Joshua Grover, a seasoned real estate photographer with over a decade of professional work under his belt, was cuffed, detained, and facing charges that is beginning to spark outrage across the constitutional rights community.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">His alleged crime? Taking photos of a townhome complex for a property listing—something he had been hired to do by the very client the police would later question. What began as a neighbor’s complaint over a man with a camera quickly morphed into a civil liberties nightmare, captured in real-time on police bodycams, dispatch audio, and a tense, revealing transcript that now serves as a damning account of First and Fourth Amendment erosion in small-town America.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An Ordinary Job Turned Constitutional Flashpoint</h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">On August 14, 2024, Grover arrived at a property in Morgan County, Utah, to do what he’d done hundreds of times before: photograph a residential unit for a real estate listing. As he walked the public-access common areas behind the home, his presence caught the attention of a neighbor. According to dispatch records, the caller reported a man “taking pictures of the rear” of the unit.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Within minutes, sheriff’s deputies arrived—guns holstered but authority drawn tight.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Put your hands behind your back,” an officer ordered.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“What did I do?” Grover asked, confused. “Why do I have to follow your orders?”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The evidence obtained reveals a now-familiar escalation: vague accusations, refusal to identify a specific crime, and pressure to comply without justification. When Grover asked what law he had broken, the response was chillingly casual:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“Possibly voyeurism. That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From Camera to Cuffs</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Grover, invoking his rights calmly, asked multiple times whether he was being detained and what he was suspected of. The answers were murky at best—and contradictory at worst. Officers accused him of failing to follow a “lawful order,” while simultaneously admitting that his presence on the property, as a hired photographer, was not illegal.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“He’s hired to do a job, and these guys know he’s here to do a job,” one officer stated in the transcript.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“It’s not good practice, but it is legal.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Despite this, officers continued to press him, demanding identification and threatening arrest when Grover refused to provide it without being informed of a charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“I just want to know what crime I’m being detained for,” Grover repeated.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“You’re going to jail if you don’t sign this,” another officer told him later.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This wasn’t just a misunderstanding. It was an exertion of power untethered from law—authority wielded against a citizen in defiance of the very constitution officers are sworn to uphold.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The System on Trial</h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">The Morgan County incident isn’t isolated. Across the United States, photographers, journalists, and citizens exercising legally protected rights to film in public have found themselves targets of wrongful arrest, intimidation, or surveillance. What distinguishes the Grover case is how clearly the transcript captures the miscarriage in action: the officers’ shifting justifications, the vague legal references, the subtle threats, the dismissal of constitutional knowledge as “bullshit.”</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“We’re going to figure it out one way or another.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I will enjoy the lawsuit. That’ll go nowhere.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But in the court of public opinion—and potentially a court of law—these words may carry consequences.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This exposé is just the beginning. Grover has since filed formal records requests for the full bodycam footage, dispatch logs, and officer personnel files. Legal action is under consideration, and a coalition of civil rights attorneys and constitutional watchdogs have begun investigating the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The question isn’t whether Grover was a threat.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It’s whether the real threat is a government that no longer respects the rights it was created to protect.</p>\n<p>This is a developing story.

Instead of administering that test, Osteen and several other officers forcibly transported Reardon to UTMB Hospital, where nurse Jacob McDougle drew blood from Reardon under duress. Reardon was pinned face-down, handcuffed, and stuck repeatedly by needles—despite voicing a documented fear of needles and objecting to the procedure.<br/><br/>The toxicology report, dated September 6, 2023, proved what Reardon had stated all along: there was no alcohol in his system.<br/><br/>Yet, in December 2023, the Galveston County District Attorney’s Office indicted Reardon for felony DWI – 3rd or more, based on a fraudulent claim that he had two prior convictions. That enhancement was allegedly fabricated by Deputy Hoby James and Deputy Kandis Beavers of the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department (Mississippi), who called Galveston PD during the arrest and falsely claimed a prior Mississippi final conviction existed. Worse still, Lafayette County Circuit Clerk Jeff Busby submitted a letter on official letterhead falsely stating that Reardon had no active appeal pending—despite court records showing otherwise.<br/><br/>Reardon was held in Galveston for nearly 11 months on a $100,000 bond before the case was abruptly dismissed by Galveston prosecutors on May 24, 2024. They then immediately recharged Reardon with a misdemeanor DWI, with the hopes of salvaging something. Reardon, held steadfast to his claim of innocence, and on May 9, 2025 it all paid off. The second dismissal, this time of the misdemeanor DWI charge , came just days before a scheduled Franks hearing, where Reardon’s attorney, Benjamin Campagna with the TX Attorney Group was set to argue that the blood draw warrant was obtained through perjury and intentional misrepresentations..</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“There were major inconsistencies between Osteen’s probable cause affidavit, other statements made under oath, and the hard evidence in the case. The great weight of the statements suggests that Osteen lied to obtain a search warrant against Mr. Reardon.” Campagna told WTPNews.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.galvnews.com/news/utah-man-sues-accuses-galveston-police-of-interstate-conspiracy/article_e83ccd89-67a4-5b47-87e3-2fca04b496da.html?utm_campaign=blox&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwQ0xDSwLAiCpleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHpyNoAaFFjrnGcJQvvLrGDcKhR5p18_nfrMMjk6NJ0PwDOx7UQLWcd1AjclG_aem_PxZOl201oH-7c2HXOqmKlQ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16398 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"16398\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"737474\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_0531-1\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-903x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-265x300.avif\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[4][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1284,1456\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/img_0531-1/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-903x1024.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-903x1024.avif 903w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-265x300.avif 265w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-768x871.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-1080x1225.avif 1080w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-1280x1451.avif 1280w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-980x1111.avif 980w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1-480x544.avif 480w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0531-1.avif 1284w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #737474;\" width=\"903\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click above to read article published by the Galveston Daily News</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br/>The lawsuit names:<br/>– Officer William Osteen and Sergeant Jack Doraty (Galveston PD)<br/>– Nurse Jacob McDougle and UTMB Health (Hospital)<br/>– Sheriff Deputies Hoby James and Kandis Beavers (Lafayette County, MS)<br/>– Circuit Clerk Jeff Busby (Lafayette County, MS)<br/>– City of Galveston, TX<br/><br/>It brings claims for malicious prosecution, excessive force, civil rights conspiracy, First Amendment retaliation, Monell liability, and false imprisonment under Texas law.</p>\n<p>“This was not a mistake,” Reardon stated.. “This was retaliation.

    "title": "Left Without Counsel, Left Without Argument: How Mississippi’s Courts Compounded Injustice in a Case the State Refuses to Defend",
    "content": "\n<p class=\"p1\">The appellate system is supposed to be a safeguard — a last line of defense ensuring that errors are corrected, due process is honored, and indigent defendants are not steamrolled by technicalities. But in Reardon v. State, a Mississippi case now stretching into its fourth year, the safeguards themselves have become the instruments of injustice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At every turn, Matthew O. Reardon — journalist, activist, and indigent appellant — has been left to face a system that refused him counsel, denied him argument, and ultimately left his appeal to languish while the State itself abandoned the case.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>The First Denial of Counsel</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">In July 2024, Reardon filed a handwritten Motion for Appointment of Counsel in Lafayette County. He cited Rule 6(b) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure and his indigency, requesting appellate representation through the State Public Defender’s Indigent Appeals Division.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On September 17, Circuit Judge J. Kelly Luther denied the motion. His reasoning: the Indigent Appeals Division only provides appellate representation for felony defendants, not misdemeanor cases like Reardon’s. By that reading, an indigent facing jail time on misdemeanor convictions could be forced to navigate appeals alone.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>The Supreme Court Steps In — and Is Ignored</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon tried again, this time going higher. On October 17, 2024, he filed a new motion with the Mississippi Supreme Court, citing controlling precedent: Evitts v. Lucey (U.S. Supreme Court, 1985), which held that the right to counsel at trial extends through a first appeal of right. He pointed to his indigency and incarceration and asked for what the Constitution promised.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On December 23, 2024, Justice T. Kenneth Griffis agreed the issue required action. He issued an order remanding the motion to Lafayette Circuit Court with a clear instruction: rule within 30 days.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The order was never followed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instead, on January 17, 2025, Judge Luther’s staff attorney, Brook Reeves, sent the appellate clerk a letter attaching the old September denial — as though it satisfied the remand. The new motion was never ruled upon. The Supreme Court’s directive was sidestepped, leaving Reardon to brief his case without counsel.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>The State Abandons Its Role</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even as Reardon struggled pro se, the State of Mississippi went silent. When Reardon filed his appellate brief on April 27, 2025 — raising constitutional violations, the denial of counsel, and due process errors — he also requested oral argument.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Attorney General’s office never filed a brief. On June 10, 2025, the appellate clerk formally declared the State in default under Rule 31(d), noting its deadline had expired. By rule, the State could not be heard at oral argument without special permission.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was a remarkable posture: the appellant had briefed, the State had not, and the record stood unrebutted.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Motion for Relief — and More Delay</h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">On June 30, 2025, Reardon moved for summary reversal, or at minimum expedited review. He argued that the State’s failure to brief was effectively a concession of error, and that each additional month of delay compounded harm: reputational, financial, and constitutional.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On July 21, 2025, Chief Judge Donna Barnes rejected the request. Citing precedent, she held that a failure to brief may be treated as a confession of error, but it does not automatically require reversal. She also refused to expedite, saying the case would be decided “in due course.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That phrase stung. For Reardon, “due course” had already meant years of ignored orders, lost counsel, and procedural stall.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>Denied Argument, Left in Silence</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">On September 2, 2025, the Court of Appeals marked the case “submitted without oral argument.” Despite Reardon’s explicit request, and despite the State’s default, the only party left in the case was denied the chance to speak.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Under Rule 34, oral argument is discretionary. But here, denying argument ensured silence from both sides. The appellee had abandoned its role; the appellant was silenced by judicial choice. A case raising multiple constitutional claims was submitted without a single live voice.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>A Pattern of Compounded Injustice</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">The trajectory of Reardon v. State illustrates not one failure, but a pattern of compounded ones:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">A trial court that denied counsel on dubious grounds. A Supreme Court order that was openly disregarded. A State that failed to defend its convictions. An Appellate Court that denied oral argument and refused to expedite, letting delay itself become punishment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The constitutional stakes are not abstract. The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear: once the state provides an appeal as of right, due process and equal protection demand meaningful access — which for indigent defendants means appointed counsel. Mississippi’s own statutes echo that guarantee. Yet here, the protections collapsed at every level.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Justice in “Due Course”?</h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">As of September 2025, the case sits fully submitted. By rule, the Court of Appeals has 270 days — until mid-2026 — to issue its decision. By then, nearly five years will have passed since the underlying misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reardon remains blunt: “This isn’t just about me. It’s about whether Mississippi courts will honor their own rules and the constitutional rights of indigent defendants.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, the silence of the State is matched by the silence of the courts. Whether Mississippi’s judiciary will break that silence in favor of justice — or let delay itself stand as a verdict — remains to be seen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://courts.ms.gov/index.php?cn=98285#dispArea\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See the Appeal Docket for Reardon here</a>.

The timing is particularly suspicious, coming just days after Reardon’s defense team filed a powerful motion to dismiss based on clear First Amendment violations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the Extra Resources?</h3>\n<p>The addition of another prosecutor raises troubling questions:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Why does the government need additional legal resources to prosecute a single journalist for peaceful protest?</li>\n<li>Is this an attempt to intimidate Reardon and drain his legal resources?</li>\n<li>Does this signal the government’s recognition that their case faces serious constitutional challenges?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Underlying Constitutional Crisis</h4>\n<p>As previously reported, Reardon was arrested on August 25, 2025, after peacefully protesting outside the federal courthouse. His protest was prompted by his discovery through a Freedom of Information Act request that U.S. Marshals had placed a BOLO (“Be On the Lookout”) alert on him simply for engaging in protected journalistic activities.</p>\n<p>The facts remain clear: Reardon was conducting constitutionally protected activities on courthouse steps—a traditional public forum where First Amendment protections are at their strongest. When asked to move his camera equipment, he complied immediately, yet was still arrested when Marshal Newsom forcibly seized his equipment.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Government’s Weak Legal Position</h5>\n<p>The government’s opposition to Reardon’s motion to dismiss reveals the weakness of their case. They attempt to redefine courthouse steps as “nonpublic forums” to justify their censorship, directly contradicting Supreme Court precedent in United States v. Grace (1983).</p>\n<p>Even more telling, the government admits they cannot address Reardon’s as-applied constitutional challenge before trial, essentially acknowledging they need to put him through the ordeal of criminal proceedings before addressing the fundamental constitutional issues at stake.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for Press Freedom</h6>\n<p>The addition of another prosecutor signals that this case has become more than just about a single incident—it represents a broader attack on press freedom and the right to criticize government actions. By allocating additional resources to prosecute a journalist for peaceful protest, the government sends a chilling message to independent media and citizen journalists everywhere.</p>\n<p>This case now represents a critical test of whether peaceful protest on courthouse steps—a location specifically recognized by the Supreme Court as a traditional public forum—can be criminalized when that protest criticizes government officials.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Path Forward</h5>\n<p>Despite the government’s escalation, Reardon’s defense remains strong, grounded in binding Supreme Court precedent that clearly protects political protest in traditional public forums. His defense team has cited Edwards v. South Carolina (1963) and United States v. Hylton, which affirm that criminal sanctions cannot be imposed for the “legitimate and protected exercise of the right to petition for the redress of grievances.”</p>\n<p>As this case proceeds with heightened government resources aligned against a single journalist, We the People News will continue to monitor developments and fight for the constitutional rights that protect all Americans’ ability to hold their government accountable.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16-complete-motion-to-dismiss-the-indictment-matthew-reardon-1.pdf\">16 – Complete Motion to Dismiss the Indictment – Matthew Reardon (1).pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16-complete-motion-to-dismiss-the-indictment-matthew-reardon-1.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20-response-in-opposition-to-motion-to-dismiss.pdf\">20- Response in Opposition to motion to dismiss.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20-response-in-opposition-to-motion-to-dismiss.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" data-od-added-id=\"\" id=\"embed-optimizer-93b1d068e92293d72a6e1624aa3946d4\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[23][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-KbQ3tJLOY?feature=oembed\" title=\"Federal Courthouse Arrest: First Amendment Under Attack\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p><em>Don Matthews is the founder of We the People News, an independent journalism platform dedicated to government accountability and constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-17002\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17002\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/breaking-government-adds-prosecutor-in-first-amendment-case-against-independent-journalist/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-17002\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-17002\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-17002\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/breaking-government-adds-prosecutor-in-first-amendment-case-against-independent-journalist/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-17002\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-17002\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-17002\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/breaking-government-adds-prosecutor-in-first-amendment-case-against-independent-journalist/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-17002\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-17002\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

Just after 2 a.m., investigative journalist and constitutional rights activist Matthew Reardon was pulled over by Galveston Police Department officers. Within minutes, what began as a traffic stop became a felony DWI investigation and arrest.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\">The officers claimed to smell alcohol. Reardon, who had not consumed a drop in years, immediately denied it and demanded a breathalyzer—the most direct way to prove sobriety. Officers refused. Instead, I they pushed for field sobriety tests that he declined, citing their unreliability, and then arrested him anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">At the hospital, the refusal to administer a breathalyzer escalated to something darker: a forced blood draw. Nearly a dozen officers restrained him while he was handcuffed, puncturing his arm multiple times with needles. No warrant was shown. <strong><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_0783.avif\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Toxicology results (PDF)</a></strong> later confirmed what Reardon had said all along: no alcohol in his system.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-the-mississippi-connection\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>The Mississippi Connection</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The arrest did not stop at Galveston’s borders. While in booking, Reardon overheard his arresting officer on the phone with Lafayette County, Mississippi Deputy Kandace Beavers—an officer who had previously testified against him in a 2021 DUI case now under appeal.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">That case remains pending before the <strong><a href=\"https://courts.ms.gov/index.php?cn=98285#dispArea\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mississippi Court of Appeals (Case No. 2024-KA-<strong>00839</strong>-COA)</a></strong>. Crucial evidence in that trial “disappeared” before the court ever saw it. Less than a year later, it was Beavers’ testimony in a separate, unrelated matter—now alleged and demonstrated as perjury—which sent Reardon to prison for a year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">On August 2, 2023, just one day after being released from prison, Reardon published a <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1ZQb_0YWmxU?si=2V6or4FoE2RDYAAO\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video exposé</a></strong> showing undeniable proof that Beavers intentionally lied under oath to send him to prison. Her voice surfacing again just 9 days later on August 11, 2023. This time through a phone call to Galveston Police officer William Osteen, pointing now to something bigger, much bigger: a cross-state conspiracy to escalate charges and silence a critic.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The call recordings couldn’t be clearer. The FBI had an obligation and responsibility to intervene, by acknowledging communication with me, that I did exactly as I was advised in trying to report law enforcement corruption involving the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department. Silence is complicity and in this case, culpability. They knew she lied and they chose to stay silent despite direct involvement. And because of their intent in not intervening and allowing such an unconscionable injustice to manifest, Beavers attacked again, and this time far worse. To this day, not a word out of the FBI. There is no question this is neglect to prevent. This nightmare has malicious intent all over it. Both by Beavers and the FBI.</p>\n<cite>-Matthew Reardon</cite></blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-the-role-of-officer-william-osteen\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>The Role of Officer William Osteen</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">At the center of the Galveston arrest was Officer William Osteen. His body-worn camera footage captured him asking, within minutes of the stop: “You an auditor man?”, telling one officer “this one’s an auditor, I got this one”, and then claiming to yet another officer that he could “go off slurred speech and the smell” to justify an arrest.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The record shows contradiction after contradiction. In his sworn <strong><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/osteen-affidavit.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">affidavit</a></strong>, Osteen marked “odor of alcoholic beverage on breath: moderate,” but later admitted he never smelled alcohol on Reardon’s breath. He testified to both “dilated pupils” and “pinpoint pupils” in separate hearings. And most damning, he falsely told the court that toxicology results showed alcohol in Reardon’s system when they did not.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">On February 25, 2025, Reardon’s attorney, Ben Campagna, filed a <strong><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/motion-for-a-franks-hearing_ocr1-compressed.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Motion for Franks Hearing (PDF)</a></strong> — a constitutional proceeding held when an officer inserts falsehoods or omits critical facts from a warrant application. If the lies are removed, there was never probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-back-to-galveston\" style=\"font-size:15px\"><strong>Back to Galveston</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">This September, Reardon returned to Galveston—not in custody, but standing outside the police department with cameras rolling. His livestreams drew national attention, part of a broader push to hold the same officers accountable who once staged his arrest.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" data-od-added-id=\"\" id=\"embed-optimizer-aa523944607c7bd8e07912fcd455fbe0\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[16][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IF2nm5IRQs?feature=oembed\" title=\"A Real Ride with The Oxford Outlaw Matthew Reardon as he returns to Galveston, TX with a message\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The trip was more than symbolic. It placed the department back under the spotlight, showing residents that Reardon was not backing down and that the fight for accountability was being waged both in the streets and in court.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" data-od-added-id=\"\" id=\"embed-optimizer-14c9cf39c67813efee52038604e6b5ad\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[18][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmtHiUpYeX4?feature=oembed\" title=\"Federal Civil Rights Summons Issued | Galveston PD &amp; Officer Osteen Exposed\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-the-federal-lawsuit\" style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>The Federal Lawsuit</strong></h5>\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Alongside the return trip came the legal escalation. In U.S. District Court, Reardon filed a sweeping <strong><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/reardon-v-osteen-et-al-filed-complaint-doc-1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">civil rights lawsuit (Complaint PDF)</a></strong> under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming the Galveston Police Department, Officer Osteen, UTMB Hospital staff, and collaborating Mississippi officials.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\">The case is now active, with <strong><a href=\"https://courts.ms.gov/index.php?cn=98285#dispArea\">federal summons issued</a></strong> requiring the defendants to formally answer. The complaint alleges false arrest, excessive force, conspiracy across jurisdictions, and violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery

Shaw Federal Courthouse in Lafayette, Louisiana. As the founder of We the People News, I’ve been following this case closely, as it represents a direct assault on press freedom and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.</p>\n<p>Court documents reveal a disturbing pattern of surveillance targeting Reardon after he discovered through a Freedom of Information Act request that U.S. Marshals had placed a BOLO (“Be On the Lookout”) alert on him simply for engaging in protected journalistic activities. Rather than addressing this concerning violation of press freedoms, federal authorities doubled down by arresting Reardon when he peacefully protested this surveillance on August 25, 2025.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Government’s Surveillance Campaign</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Peaceful Protest Met With Excessive Force</h3>\n<p>The facts are clear: Reardon was conducting a constitutionally protected protest on the courthouse steps, a traditional public forum where First Amendment activities have historically received the highest level of protection. His protest signs criticized what he perceived as unlawful targeting of his journalism through the BOLO alert.</p>\n<p>When Marshal Hayden Newsom invited Reardon inside the courthouse only to immediately threaten him with arrest for recording, Reardon peacefully exited the building. Despite complying with all directives and maintaining a peaceful demeanor throughout the encounter, Reardon was ultimately arrested when Marshal Newsom forcibly seized his camera equipment.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constitutional Rights Trampled</h4>\n<p>Reardon’s defense team has filed a powerful motion to dismiss, citing binding Supreme Court precedent that clearly protects political protest in traditional public forums. The motion references Edwards v. South Carolina (1963), where the Supreme Court protected protesters who engaged in “boisterous, loud, and flamboyant conduct” while expressing political grievances.</p>\n<p>The defense motion also cites United States v. Hylton, where the Fifth Circuit affirmed that criminal sanctions cannot be imposed for the “legitimate and protected exercise of the right to petition for the redress of grievances.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Government’s Weak Response</h5>\n<p>The government’s opposition filing reveals the weakness of their case. They attempt to redefine courthouse steps—long recognized as traditional public forums—as “nonpublic forums” to justify their censorship. This directly contradicts Supreme Court precedent in United States v. Grace (1983), which established that “the public sidewalks forming the perimeter of the Supreme Court grounds… are public forums and should be treated as such for First Amendment purposes.”</p>\n<p>Even more troubling, the government admits they cannot address Reardon’s as-applied constitutional challenge before trial, essentially acknowledging they need to put him through the ordeal of criminal proceedings before addressing the fundamental constitutional issues at stake.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Three Protected Activities Criminalized</strong></h6>\n<p>The government’s prosecution targets three forms of constitutionally protected expression:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Political Speech</strong>: Reardon’s protest signs and spoken commentary criticizing government surveillance fall within “the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free expression” according to Supreme Court precedent.</li>\n<li><strong>Press Activity</strong>: As an investigative journalist documenting events for his 3,000-subscriber YouTube channel, Reardon’s recording activities are protected under the First Amendment’s press clause.</li>\n<li><strong>Petition for Redress</strong>: Reardon’s expression of grievances against government officials constitutes petitioning for redress, which the Supreme Court has called “among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Content-Based Targeting</h3>\n<p>Perhaps most disturbing is the evidence of content-based discrimination. Reardon was targeted not because of any genuine disruption—the defense motion notes that “members of the public continued to enter and exit the courthouse during his protest without incident”—but because of the critical content of his message about federal law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The government’s claim that Reardon obstructed an entrance falls apart when examining the facts: he placed his camera near a door that was permanently locked to public access, meaning there was no “usual use” to obstruct. When asked to move the camera, Reardon immediately complied, demonstrating his respect for legitimate security concerns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s At Stake</h2>\n<p>This case represents a dangerous precedent for independent journalists and citizens who dare to criticize government actions. If peaceful protest on courthouse steps—a location specifically recognized by the Supreme Court as a traditional public forum—can be criminalized, then the First Amendment protections we all rely on are in grave danger.</p>\n<p>As this case proceeds, We the People News will continue to monitor developments and fight for the constitutional rights that protect all Americans’ ability to hold their government accountable.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01-complaint.pdf\">01 – Complaint.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01-complaint.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/03-bill-of-information.pdf\">03 – Bill of Information.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/03-bill-of-information.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07-minutes-from-ia-arraignment.pdf\">07 – Minutes from IA-Arraignment.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07-minutes-from-ia-arraignment.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-release-order.pdf\">08 – Release Order.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-release-order.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09-due-process-order.pdf\">09 – Due Process Order.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09-due-process-order.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/12-defense-discovery-request.pdf\">12 – Defense Discovery Request.pdf</a><a class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/12-defense-discovery-request.pdf\">Download</a></div>\n<p><em>Don Matthews is the founder of We the People News, an independent journalism platform dedicated to government accountability and constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-16997\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16997\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/federal-courthouse-arrest-first-amendment-under-attack/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-16997\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-16997\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-16997\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/federal-courthouse-arrest-first-amendment-under-attack/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-16997\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-16997\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-16997\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/federal-courthouse-arrest-first-amendment-under-attack/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-16997\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-16997\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

He discovers federal agents issued a “Be On the Lookout” (BOLO) alert targeting him for documenting government activities at public courthouses. He peacefully protests this surveillance on courthouse steps. Federal marshals arrest him, seize his recording equipment, and charge him with “making loud noise.” Now, those same federal agents want a judge to ban him from talking about any of it.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/000412-responsive-records.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17034 not-transparent\" data-attachment-id=\"17034\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-dominant-color=\"f1e9e8\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Screenshot&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Screenshot\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Screenshot\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"FOIA\" data-large-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-788x1024.avif\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-231x300.avif\" data-od-unknown-tag=\"\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[5][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428.avif\" data-orig-size=\"1208,1570\" data-permalink=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/screenshot-35/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" src=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-788x1024.avif\" srcset=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-788x1024.avif 788w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-231x300.avif 231w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-768x998.avif 768w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428-1182x1536.avif 1182w, https://www.wtpnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1428.avif 1208w\" style=\"--dominant-color: #f1e9e8;\" width=\"788\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click to see all 14 redacted records</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“They’re Trying to Memory-Hole Their Own Misconduct”</h2>\n<p>“This is exactly what the First Amendment was designed to prevent,” said Matthew Reardon. “They surveilled me for journalism. They arrested me for protesting that surveillance. They prosecuted me for protected speech. And now they want to silence me from reporting on their own actions.”</p>\n<p>The protective order motion, filed October 15, 2025, would prohibit Reardon from:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Possessing copies of discovery materials about his arrest</li>\n<li>Discussing those materials publicly</li>\n<li>Publishing analysis of government conduct</li>\n<li>Retaining any records after his case concludes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government claims the restrictions are necessary for “courthouse security.” But Reardon’s legal team calls that justification “pretextual” and points to a damning timeline.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Four-Phase Suppression Campaign</h3>\n<p>Court documents reveal a systematic pattern:</p>\n<p><strong>PHASE ONE: SURVEILLANCE</strong><br/>U.S. Marshals issue BOLO alert targeting Reardon for journalism activities at federal facilities. No threats. No attempted entry to restricted areas. Just journalism.</p>\n<p><strong>PHASE TWO: ARREST</strong><br/>When Reardon peacefully protests the surveillance on August 25, 2025, Marshal Hayden Nugent arrests him and seizes his camera equipment—mid-livestream, in front of his 3,000+ YouTube subscribers.</p>\n<p><strong>PHASE THREE: PROSECUTION</strong><br/>Federal prosecutors charge Reardon under regulations prohibiting “loud noise” and “obstruction” for conduct that video evidence shows was peaceful and non-disruptive.</p>\n<p><strong>PHASE FOUR: SILENCING</strong><br/>On the same day a magistrate judge indicates she’ll consolidate Reardon’s constitutional challenge with trial, the government files a motion seeking to prohibit him from discussing evidence that supports his First Amendment defense.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Government’s Own Actions Undermine Security Claims</h4>\n<p>Perhaps most tellingly, the government’s own conduct contradicts its security concerns:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>They filmed him too</strong>: A federal security officer recorded Reardon’s protest on what appears to be a personal cellphone. If recording near courthouses threatens security, why did government personnel do exactly that?</li>\n<li><strong>They waited 20+ minutes</strong>: If Reardon’s camera created an urgent security threat, why did marshals wait over twenty minutes before addressing it?</li>\n<li><strong>They disclosed the BOLO through FOIA</strong>: The government determined that information about its surveillance of Reardon could be publicly released. Now they claim that same information compromises security?</li>\n<li><strong>They’re selective about enforcement</strong>: Federal cases routinely involve discovery of courthouse security footage, marshal communications, and operational procedures. The government doesn’t seek protective orders in those cases. Only when the defendant is a journalist publishing critical content.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[20][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"731\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDWo45f1EJQ?feature=oembed\" title=\"Journalist violently attacked, kidnapped, and tortured by US Marshals and St Martin Parish\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“This Is About Silencing Criticism, Not Protecting Security”</h5>\n<p>The government’s motion explicitly references Reardon’s YouTube publications and his stated intent to “stress test the system”—revealing that content, not security, drives their concern.</p>\n<p>“YouTube is full of videos about courthouse exteriors, federal law enforcement activities, and First Amendment audits,” notes Reardon’s opposition brief. “The government doesn’t seek protective orders against those publishers. The selective concern about Mr. Reardon’s videos demonstrates that viewpoint, not security, motivates this motion.”</p>\n<p>The proposed order would prohibit Reardon from discussing:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Communications about why marshals placed him under surveillance</li>\n<li>Emails between marshals and judges about his journalism </li>\n<li>Video footage of his arrest (which he livestreamed publicly)</li>\n<li>Analysis of whether his prosecution violates the First Amendment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of this information poses security threats. All of it documents potential constitutional violations that the public has a compelling interest in knowing about.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constitutional Scholars: “Textbook Prior Restraint”</h6>\n<p>Legal experts say the protective order motion represents one of the most aggressive attempts to silence a journalist in recent memory.</p>\n<p>“Prior restraints on publication are ‘the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights,'” explains Reardon’s legal brief, quoting Supreme Court precedent. “The government has failed to meet—indeed, has not even attempted to meet—the heavy burden required to justify such restrictions.”</p>\n<p>To overcome the presumption against prior restraints, the government must demonstrate:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Substantial likelihood of serious, specific harm</li>\n<li>Grave and imminent threats, not speculation</li>\n<li>No adequate alternatives to restriction</li>\n<li>Narrow tailoring to prevent only identified harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government has done none of this. Instead, it offers vague assertions about “courthouse security” and “operational methods” without identifying a single specific document requiring protection or explaining how Reardon’s journalism could facilitate any security threat.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bigger Picture: Criminalizing Journalism</h3>\n<p>This case is part of a disturbing trend of federal agencies targeting journalists who document government conduct.</p>\n<p>Reardon operates We the People News, an investigative journalism platform with over 3,000 YouTube subscribers. His reporting focuses on government accountability, law enforcement activities, and constitutional rights in public spaces—exactly the type of journalism the First Amendment most vigorously protects.</p>\n<p>“Citizens have a fundamental right to know when government agencies place journalists under surveillance,” Reardon’s legal team argues. “They have a right to know when federal officers arrest citizens for peaceful protest. They have a right to know when prosecutions target constitutionally protected expression.”</p>\n<p>The protective order would eliminate that transparency by:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Preventing Reardon from reporting on his own prosecution</li>\n<li>Requiring destruction of all materials after trial, eliminating any historical record</li>\n<li>Chilling other journalists who might document federal law enforcement</li>\n<li>Signaling that criticizing the government carries consequences</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“If They Can Do This to Me, They Can Do It to Anyone”</h2>\n<p>Reardon remains defiant despite the escalating pressure.</p>\n<p>“I’m a Marine veteran. I took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” he said. “I never imagined that oath would require defending the First Amendment against the very government I served.”</p>\n<p>He continues publishing journalism about the case, including:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>FOIA responses documenting the BOLO surveillance</li>\n<li>Video footage of his arrest</li>\n<li>Analysis of government conduct</li>\n<li>Interviews with law enforcement officials</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government’s motion explicitly objects to these publications—proving, Reardon argues, that suppression of criticism is the true objective.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens Next?</h4>\n<p>The court will rule on the protective order motion in the coming weeks. If granted, it would set a dangerous precedent: the government could silence any journalist simply by prosecuting them and then claiming discovery materials are “sensitive.”</p>\n<p>If denied, it would reaffirm that the First Amendment means what it says—that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press, and that government officials cannot exploit criminal prosecution to accomplish censorship they could never achieve directly.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t just about me,” Reardon emphasizes. “This is about whether we still have a free press in America. This is about whether the government can surveil journalists, arrest them for protesting that surveillance, prosecute them for protected speech, and then silence them from reporting on any of it.”</p>\n<p>“If they can do this to me, they can do it to anyone.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of Events</h5>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pre-August 2025</strong>: U.S. Marshals issue BOLO alert targeting Reardon for journalism activities</li>\n<li><strong>August 2025</strong>: Reardon discovers BOLO through FOIA request</li>\n<li><strong>August 25, 2025</strong>: Reardon peacefully protests on courthouse steps; Marshal Hayden Nugent arrests him and seizes equipment</li>\n<li><strong>September-October 2025</strong>: Reardon files motion to dismiss on First Amendment grounds</li>\n<li><strong>October 15, 2025</strong>: Same day magistrate indicates constitutional challenge will go to trial, government files protective order motion</li>\n<li><strong>Present</strong>: Court considering whether to prohibit journalist from discussing his own prosecution</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Public Response</h4>\n<p>“This is government censorship, plain and simple,” wrote one commenter. “They’re not protecting security—they’re protecting themselves from accountability.”</p>\n<p>Another added: “They surveilled him for journalism. Arrested him for protesting. Prosecuted him for speech. Now they want to silence him.

The timing, scope, and selective enforcement tell a different story.</p>\n<p>This is about silencing criticism. This is about preventing accountability. This is about whether the First Amendment still means anything when the government decides a journalist has become inconvenient.</p>\n<p>Matthew Reardon refuses to be silenced.

Through a series of phone calls documented in September and October 2025, sheriff’s department personnel repeatedly refused to provide basic public information about defendants Beavers and James, engaged in evasive tactics, and demonstrated what appears to be a coordinated effort to prevent public access to information that should be readily available under Mississippi public records law.</p>\n<p>The investigation reveals:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Systematic Refusal to Provide Information</strong>: Multiple calls met with stonewalling, excuses, and refusals to provide basic booking information</li>\n<li><strong>Contradictory Statements</strong>: Department personnel provided conflicting information about record availability and procedures</li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious Behavior</strong>: Evidence of coordination between staff members to obstruct information requests</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Legal Violations</strong>: Actions that may violate Mississippi Public Records Act and obstruction of justice statutes</li>\n<li><strong>Pattern of Retaliation</strong>: Targeting of journalist who has documented law enforcement misconduct</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This report documents the complete timeline of obstruction, analyzes the legal implications, and exposes what appears to be a deliberate campaign to conceal information from public scrutiny.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-part-i-the-investigation-begins\">PART I: THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-background-why-these-defendants-matter\">Background: Why These Defendants Matter</h3>\n<p>The Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department holds information about two defendants—identified in this investigation as Beavers and James—whose cases have raised significant questions about law enforcement conduct, due process, and transparency in Mississippi’s criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>When We the People News began investigating these cases, we encountered immediate resistance from the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department. What should have been a routine public records request turned into a months-long saga of obstruction, evasion, and what can only be described as deliberate concealment.</p>\n<p>Under Mississippi law, public records are presumptively open to public inspection. The Mississippi Public Records Act (Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1 et seq.) establishes that:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Public records are open</strong>: All public records shall be open for inspection by any citizen</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt response required</strong>: Agencies must respond to requests within a reasonable time</li>\n<li><strong>Limited exceptions</strong>: Only specific, enumerated exceptions allow withholding</li>\n<li><strong>Criminal penalties</strong>: Willful violation can result in criminal charges</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Booking records, arrest information, and basic defendant data are quintessential public records. There is no legitimate basis for refusing to provide this information to journalists or citizens.</p>\n<p>Yet that is exactly what the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department did.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-part-ii-the-phone-calls-a-timeline-of-obstruction\">PART II: THE PHONE CALLS – A TIMELINE OF OBSTRUCTION</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-september-22-2025-the-first-call-definitely-plotting-and-planning\">September 22, 2025: The First Call – “Definitely Plotting and Planning”</h3>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>: Initial attempt to obtain information about defendants Beavers and James.</p>\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The first call to the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department set the tone for what would become a pattern of obstruction. When We the People News requested basic booking information about the defendants, the response was immediate resistance.</p>\n<p>A female staff member—later identified in subsequent calls as “Karen”—provided evasive answers, claimed records were unavailable, and suggested calling back at a different time. The interaction was documented on video and later published on YouTube with the title: “EXCLUSIVE PHONE CALL with Sheriff’s Secretary for St Martin Parish Sheriffs Office 9-22-2025.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" data-od-added-id=\"\" id=\"embed-optimizer-93b1d068e92293d72a6e1624aa3946d4\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[23][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvNsjnp7rZ8?feature=oembed\" title=\"These Tyrants are up to no good at the Lafayette County Sheriffs Department (Again).

This call, documented in a YouTube video titled “PT 2: KAREN AT LAFAYETTE COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT CALLS BACK. DEFINITELY PLOTTING AND PLANNING,” revealed even more concerning behavior.</p>\n<p>The callback was not to provide the requested information. Instead, it appeared designed to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Determine what information the journalist already possessed</li>\n<li>Gauge the scope of the investigation</li>\n<li>Potentially coordinate a response with other officials</li>\n<li>Further delay or obstruct the information request</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" data-od-xpath=\"/HTML/BODY/DIV[@id='page']/*[3][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[32][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::DIV]\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHiaadty-3M?feature=oembed\" title=\"PT 2: KAREN AT LAFAYETTE COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT CALLS BACK.

This obstruction undermines transparency, accountability, and press freedom.</p>\n<p>I urge you to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Investigate these violations immediately</li>\n<li>Ensure compliance with public records laws</li>\n<li>Hold accountable those who violated the law</li>\n<li>Implement reforms to prevent future obstruction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Government transparency is not optional. It is the law. And the law must be enforced.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your City, State]”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department’s obstruction is not just about two defendants. It’s not just about one journalist. It’s not even just about Mississippi.</p>\n<p>It’s about whether we still have a government that is accountable to the people. It’s about whether transparency laws mean anything. It’s about whether journalists can do their jobs without retaliation.</p>\n<p><strong>The answer to those questions depends on what happens next.</strong></p>\n<p>If the obstruction continues without consequences, the message is clear: transparency laws are meaningless, journalists can be targeted with impunity, and government can operate in secret.</p>\n<p>But if there are consequences—if officials are held accountable, if the law is enforced, if transparency is restored—then the message is different: government serves the people, not the other way around.</p>\n<p><strong>The choice is ours.</strong></p>\n<p>We can accept obstruction, secrecy, and retaliation. Or we can demand transparency, accountability, and justice.</p>\n<p>We the People News has made our choice. We will continue investigating. We will continue reporting. We will continue demanding transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>The question is: What will you choose?</strong></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION</strong></p>\n<p>This investigation was conducted by Matthew Reardon, founder and publisher of We the People News, a Marine veteran and investigative journalist committed to government accountability and transparency.

Ex Parte Communications</h3>\n<p><strong>What It Is:</strong><br/>An ex parte communication is a one-sided communication between a party (or law enforcement acting on behalf of a party) and a judge about a case, without the opposing party being present or having an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Prohibited:</strong><br/>The Code of Conduct for United States Judges, Canon 3(A)(4), explicitly states:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“A judge should not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers concerning a pending or impending proceeding.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Violation Here:</strong><br/>U.S. Marshals communicated with court personnel (potentially including judges) about Reardon before any charges were filed. This communication:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Was one-sided (only the government’s perspective)</li>\n<li>Occurred without Reardon’s knowledge</li>\n<li>Gave Reardon no opportunity to respond</li>\n<li>Created prejudice before any legal proceeding began</li>\n<li>Concerned an “impending proceeding” (charges filed two months later)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This is a textbook ex parte communication violation.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-judicial-bias-and-required-recusal\">2. Judicial Bias and Required Recusal</h3>\n<p><strong>The Standard:</strong><br/>28 U.S.C. § 455(a) requires that “Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Application:</strong><br/>Any judge or magistrate judge who received these prejudicial communications about Reardon:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Was exposed to one-sided information from law enforcement</li>\n<li>Heard characterization of Reardon as “suspicious”</li>\n<li>Received reports about him before any charges were filed</li>\n<li>Formed impressions based on ex parte communications</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A reasonable person would question the impartiality of any judge who received these communications.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, any such judge MUST recuse from Reardon’s case.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-due-process-violations\">3. Due Process Violations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Constitutional Right:</strong><br/>The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Violation:</strong><br/>Reardon was denied due process when:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Law enforcement communicated with judges about him without his knowledge</li>\n<li>He was given no opportunity to respond to these communications</li>\n<li>Prejudicial information was shared before charges were filed</li>\n<li>He was denied the right to an impartial tribunal</li>\n<li>The protective order would prevent him from ever learning which judges received the communications</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Without knowing which judges received these ex parte communications, Reardon cannot seek their recusal. He cannot challenge bias he doesn’t know exists.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-first-amendment-retaliation\">4. First Amendment Retaliation</h2>\n<p>The ex parte communications are evidence of a coordinated campaign to target Reardon for protected First Amendment activity:</p>\n<p><strong>The Pattern:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reardon engages in journalism documenting government conduct</li>\n<li>U.S. Marshals place him under surveillance (BOLO alert)</li>\n<li>U.S. Marshals send prejudicial communications to judges characterizing his journalism as “suspicious”</li>\n<li>Reardon protests the surveillance</li>\n<li>U.S. Marshals arrest him</li>\n<li>Government prosecutes him</li>\n<li>Government seeks to hide evidence of the ex parte communications</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This demonstrates viewpoint-based targeting of a journalist for protected activities.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-cover-up-government-s-protective-order-motion\">THE COVER-UP: Government’s Protective Order Motion</h3>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-the-government-admits\">What the Government Admits</h5>\n<p>The government’s motion for protective order, filed October 15, 2025, explicitly seeks to restrict:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“sensitive courthouse security operational plans, and <strong>communications between the Marshal service and the Federal Judges</strong> at the John Shaw Courthouse”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>This is an admission.</strong> The government is not denying that communications with judges exist. They are trying to <strong>conceal</strong> them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-government-s-justification-security\">The Government’s Justification: “Security”</h3>\n<p>The government claims these communications must be protected for “courthouse security” reasons. But this justification is transparently pretextual:</p>\n<p><strong>These Communications Are Not About Security:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They characterize Reardon’s journalism as “suspicious”</li>\n<li>They create a prejudicial narrative about him</li>\n<li>They were sent to judges and chambers staff, not just security personnel</li>\n<li>They demonstrate targeting of protected First Amendment activity</li>\n<li>They establish grounds for judicial recusal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>These Communications Are About Bias:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They prejudiced judges against Reardon before charges were filed</li>\n<li>They violated ex parte communication rules</li>\n<li>They created the appearance (and likely the reality) of judicial bias</li>\n<li>They demonstrate coordination between law enforcement and the court</li>\n<li>They are evidence of government misconduct</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The government is not protecting “security”—it is protecting itself from accountability.</strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-the-protective-order-would-conceal\">What the Protective Order Would Conceal</h4>\n<p>If granted, the protective order would prevent Reardon from ever learning:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Which judges</strong> received the ex parte communications</li>\n<li><strong>What specific information</strong> was shared beyond what FOIA revealed</li>\n<li><strong>When</strong> the communications occurred</li>\n<li><strong>Whether any judge</strong> responded to or acted upon the communications</li>\n<li><strong>Whether any judge</strong> formed opinions about Reardon based on them</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Without this information, Reardon cannot:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Challenge judicial bias</li>\n<li>Seek recusal of prejudiced judges</li>\n<li>Demonstrate the coordinated nature of the government’s targeting</li>\n<li>Establish First Amendment retaliation</li>\n<li>Receive a fair trial</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The protective order would deny Reardon due process by concealing evidence of judicial bias.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-reardon-s-vindication-i-have-to-know\">REARDON’S VINDICATION: “I Have to Know”</h2>\n<p>Months ago, when the government first filed its protective order motion, Reardon stated:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“I have to know if any judge that is involved had any prior communication about me which could introduce bias and serious judicial violations.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>He was right.</strong></p>\n<p>The FOIA records prove that such communications occurred. The protective order motion admits they exist. And the government is desperately trying to hide them.</p>\n<p>Reardon’s insistence on transparency was not paranoia—it was prescience. He suspected what the evidence now proves: the government communicated with judges about him before filing charges, creating bias that taints the entire proceeding.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-textbook-ex-parte-violation\">“Textbook Ex Parte Violation”</h3>\n<p>“This is a textbook ex parte communication violation. Law enforcement cannot send prejudicial information about a defendant to judges before charges are filed. The fact that this occurred two months before the arrest makes it even more egregious—it shows premeditation and coordination.</p>\n<p>Any judge who received these communications is biased and must recuse. The protective order motion is an attempt to prevent the defendant from discovering which judges are biased so he can’t challenge them. That’s a due process violation.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unprecedented-cover-up-attempt\">“Unprecedented Cover-Up Attempt”</h3>\n<p>“I’ve never seen anything quite like this. The government is explicitly seeking a protective order to conceal communications with judges that violate judicial ethics rules. They’re not even trying to hide what they’re doing—they’re admitting the communications exist and asking the court to help them cover it up.</p>\n<p>If this protective order is granted, it will set a dangerous precedent: the government can prejudice judges against defendants through ex parte communications, then use protective orders to prevent defendants from ever learning about it. That would be the end of judicial impartiality.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-first-amendment-implications\">“First Amendment Implications”</h3>\n<p>“This case demonstrates why transparency is so essential. The government surveilled a journalist for protected activities, sent prejudicial communications to judges about him, arrested him when he protested, and now seeks to hide evidence of all of it.</p>\n<p>If they succeed, the message to journalists is clear: document government misconduct and you’ll be targeted, prosecuted, and denied a fair trial. And you’ll never even know which judges were prejudiced against you. That’s a chilling effect on steroids.”THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS: What This Means for Justice</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-if-the-protective-order-is-granted\">If the Protective Order Is Granted</h3>\n<p><strong>The Consequences:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Defendants will never know if judges received ex parte communications about them</li>\n<li>Judicial bias can persist unchecked</li>\n<li>Government can coordinate with courts to target critics</li>\n<li>Ex parte communication rules become meaningless</li>\n<li>Due process becomes a fiction</li>\n<li>Fair trials become impossible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Precedent:</strong><br/>Any prosecutor could:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Send prejudicial information to judges before filing charges</li>\n<li>Create bias against defendants</li>\n<li>Seek protective orders to conceal the communications</li>\n<li>Prevent defendants from challenging biased judges</li>\n<li>Obtain convictions from prejudiced tribunals</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This would fundamentally undermine judicial integrity.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-if-the-protective-order-is-denied\">If the Protective Order Is Denied</h3>\n<p><strong>The Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Government must disclose which judges received communications</li>\n<li>Reardon can seek recusal of biased judges</li>\n<li>Ex parte communication rules are enforced</li>\n<li>Judicial ethics violations are exposed</li>\n<li>Government accountability is maintained</li>\n<li>Due process is protected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Message:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Courts will not be complicit in concealing government misconduct</li>\n<li>Judicial impartiality is non-negotiable</li>\n<li>Transparency is essential to justice</li>\n<li>Ex parte communications will not be tolerated</li>\n<li>Defendants have a right to challenge bias</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This would reaffirm the integrity of the judicial system.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-government-s-provocation-they-created-this-problem\">THE GOVERNMENT’S PROVOCATION: They Created This Problem</h2>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-causal-chain\">The Causal Chain</h5>\n<p>The government initiated every step of this scandal:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Surveillance</strong><br/>Government places journalist under surveillance (BOLO alert) for protected activities</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Ex Parte Communications</strong><br/>Government sends prejudicial information to judges before filing charges</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Arrest</strong><br/>Government arrests journalist when he protests the surveillance</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Prosecution</strong><br/>Government charges journalist for constitutionally protected expression</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Cover-Up</strong><br/>Government seeks protective order to hide evidence of ex parte communications</p>\n<p><strong>The government provoked this entire situation.</strong> It cannot now hide behind “security” to conceal its own misconduct.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-government-s-choice\">The Government’s Choice</h3>\n<p>The government had options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1: Transparency</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Proceed with prosecution</li>\n<li>Comply with discovery obligations</li>\n<li>Accept public scrutiny of its conduct</li>\n<li>Face accountability if misconduct is revealed</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option 2: Concealment</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Dismiss the prosecution</li>\n<li>Avoid discovery obligations</li>\n<li>Prevent public scrutiny</li>\n<li>Maintain secrecy about its conduct</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What the government cannot do:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Proceed with prosecution AND</li>\n<li>Avoid discovery obligations AND</li>\n<li>Prevent public scrutiny AND</li>\n<li>Escape accountability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Yet this is exactly what the protective order seeks to accomplish.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-reardon-s-response-transparency-is-a-requirement\">REARDON’S RESPONSE: “Transparency Is a Requirement”</h2>\n<p>In a statement to We the People News, Reardon explained why the protective order must be denied:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“The motion even states: ‘Certain discoverable materials are sensitive courthouse security operational plans, and communications between the Marshal service and the Federal Judges at the John Shaw Courthouse.’</p>\n<p>This is all the more reason why transparency is a requirement in this.

Now government wants protective order to HIDE the evidence. This is a judicial ethics scandal.” </p>\n<p>“If the government can prejudice judges against defendants through ex parte communications, then hide those communications behind protective orders, NO ONE can get a fair trial. This is terrifying.” </p>\n<p>“They surveilled him. They emailed judges about him. They arrested him. Now they want to hide the emails. This is what government corruption looks like.” –</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-calls-for-investigation\">Calls for Investigation</h3>\n<p>Multiple organizations have called for investigations:</p>\n<p><strong>American Civil Liberties Union:</strong><br/>“The ex parte communications revealed in this case raise serious concerns about judicial impartiality and due process. We call on the Fifth Circuit Judicial Council to investigate these communications and take appropriate action.”</p>\n<p><strong>Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press:</strong><br/>“The government’s attempt to use a protective order to conceal ex parte communications with judges demonstrates why transparency in judicial proceedings is so essential. This case has significant implications for press freedom and government accountability.”</p>\n<p><strong>National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers:</strong><br/>“Ex parte communications between law enforcement and judges strike at the heart of the adversarial system. If defendants cannot learn about such communications and challenge biased judges, the right to a fair trial becomes meaningless.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-stakes-why-this-case-matters-to-everyone\">THE STAKES: Why This Case Matters to Everyone</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-just-about-one-journalist\">Not Just About One Journalist</h3>\n<p>While this case involves a journalist targeted for documenting government conduct, the implications extend to every American:</p>\n<p><strong>If the government can:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Communicate with judges about defendants before filing charges</li>\n<li>Create prejudice through one-sided information</li>\n<li>Hide those communications behind protective orders</li>\n<li>Prevent defendants from challenging biased judges</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Then no one can get a fair trial.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-precedent\">The Precedent</h3>\n<p><strong>If the protective order is granted:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Every prosecutor can prejudice judges through ex parte communications</li>\n<li>Every defendant can be denied knowledge of judicial bias</li>\n<li>Every trial can proceed before a prejudiced tribunal</li>\n<li>Every conviction can be tainted by hidden bias</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If the protective order is denied:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ex parte communication rules are enforced</li>\n<li>Judicial ethics violations are exposed</li>\n<li>Defendants can challenge biased judges</li>\n<li>Fair trials are protected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The court’s decision will determine which system we have.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-principle\">The Principle</h3>\n<p>At its core, this case is about a fundamental principle: <strong>government cannot hide its own misconduct</strong>.</p>\n<p>When government:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Violates constitutional rights</li>\n<li>Breaks judicial ethics rules</li>\n<li>Engages in ex parte communications</li>\n<li>Creates judicial bias</li>\n<li>Targets critics for protected activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It cannot then use its power to conceal evidence of these violations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transparency is not optional. It is essential to justice.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion-the-fight-for-transparency\">CONCLUSION: The Fight for Transparency</h2>\n<p>Matthew Reardon’s case has exposed a judicial ethics scandal that threatens the integrity of the federal court system. The evidence is clear:</p>\n<p><strong>What We Know:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>U.S. Marshals sent prejudicial communications about Reardon to federal judges before filing charges</li>\n<li>These communications violated ex parte rules</li>\n<li>Any judge who received them is biased and must recuse</li>\n<li>The government is trying to hide these communications</li>\n<li>The protective order would deny Reardon due process</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What We Don’t Know:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Which specific judges received the communications</li>\n<li>What additional information was shared</li>\n<li>Whether any judge acted on the communications</li>\n<li>The full extent of the coordination between law enforcement and the court</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What We Must Demand:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Denial of the protective order</li>\n<li>Full disclosure of ex parte communications</li>\n<li>Recusal of biased judges</li>\n<li>Investigation by the Judicial Council</li>\n<li>Accountability for ethics violations</li>\n<li>Protection of due process rights</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The government provoked this situation. The government created the bias. The government violated the rules. And the government must now accept the consequences: transparency, accountability, and justice.</strong></p>\n<p>As Reardon stated: “Transparency is a disinfectant and it must be transparency on this issue that the government is desperately trying to cover up.”</p>\n<p><strong>The question is: Will the court allow the government to hide its misconduct, or will it require the transparency that justice demands?</strong></p>\n<p>The answer will determine not just the outcome of this case, but the integrity of the judicial system itself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-you-can-help\">HOW YOU CAN HELP</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Hearing Defense</h1>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">On October 15, 2025, Judge Whitehurst issued what she calls an “Interim Order” that:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list list-decimal pl-5 my-2\">\n<li><strong>Restricts access to discovery materials</strong> containing “courthouse security information”</li>\n<li><strong>Defines “security information” to include EMAILS</strong> – the very ex parte communications to judges</li>\n<li><strong>Requires all materials be kept in a “secure place”</strong>with restricted viewing</li>\n<li><strong>Acts immediately</strong> – before defense can file opposition (due October 22)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-what-ex-parte-order-means\">WHAT “EX PARTE ORDER” MEANS</h2>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">An <strong>“ex parte order”</strong> means the judge granted relief to one party (the government) without hearing from the other party (the defense) first.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">What happened:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li><strong>Morning:</strong> Government files motion for protective order</li>\n<li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Judge grants it as “interim order”</li>\n<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Defense response not due until October 22 (7 days away)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Judge Whitehurst acted on the government’s motion without waiting for the defense to respond. This denied Reardon:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>The opportunity to be heard</li>\n<li>Due process</li>\n<li>The ability to argue against the restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">This is highly unusual and suggests urgency to hide something.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-the-smoking-gun-what-she-s-trying-to-hide\">THE SMOKING GUN: What She’s Trying to Hide</h3>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The order specifically defines “courthouse security information” as:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote border-l-4 border-muted pl-4 italic my-2 is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">“information including <strong>emails</strong>, camera footage, or other law enforcement sensitive materials that may tend to reveal the methods or operational behavior of the US Marshal”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>Translation:</strong> The emails between U.S. Marshals and federal judges – the ex parte communications that violate judicial ethics rules – are now classified as “security information.”</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-why-this-is-outrageous\">WHY THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS</h4>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading text-lg font-bold my-2\" id=\"h-1-the-emails-are-not-security-information\">1. The Emails Are NOT Security Information</h5>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The ex parte communications revealed by FOIA records:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>Were sent to <strong>judges and chambers staff</strong> (@lawd.uscourts.gov addresses)</li>\n<li>Characterized Reardon’s journalism as “suspicious behavior”</li>\n<li>Created prejudice against Reardon before charges were filed</li>\n<li>Violated the Code of Conduct for United States Judges</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>These are evidence of judicial ethics violations, not security protocols.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-4 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex

She Granted Government’s Motion Without Hearing Defense</h3>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The order acknowledges that “defense objects to the Motion” and sets the response deadline as October 22, 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">But she granted the government’s motion on October 15, 2025 – <strong>the same day they filed it</strong> – a full week before the defense response is due.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>No emergency justified this.</strong> Courts can issue ex parte orders only when:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>There’s a genuine emergency</li>\n<li>Delay would cause irreparable harm</li>\n<li>Notice would defeat the purpose</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>None of these factors exist here:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>Reardon has had discovery for weeks without incident</li>\n<li>No security breach has occurred</li>\n<li>Government identified no specific threat</li>\n<li>Waiting 7 days would cause no harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">This denies Reardon:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>The opportunity to be heard</li>\n<li>Due process</li>\n<li>The ability to argue against the restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading text-lg font-bold my-2\" id=\"h-3-she-may-have-received-the-ex-parte-communications-herself\">3. She May Have Received the Ex Parte Communications Herself</h2>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Here’s the critical question: <strong>Did Magistrate Judge Whitehurst receive any of the ex parte communications about Reardon?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">FOIA records prove U.S. Marshals sent emails to multiple @lawd.uscourts.gov addresses on June 24 and 26, 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Judge Whitehurst uses an @lawd.uscourts.gov email address.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>If she received those communications, she is biased and must recuse.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Her immediate action to grant the government’s protective order—without hearing from the defense—suggests she may have something to hide. Why the rush to protect these communications from disclosure?</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-the-catch-22-protecting-judicial-bias\">THE CATCH-22: Protecting Judicial Bias</h4>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The Interim Order creates an impossible situation:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list list-decimal pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>Reardon suspects judges received ex parte communications (confirmed by FOIA)</li>\n<li>Discovery materials would reveal which judges received them</li>\n<li>But the order prevents Reardon from viewing those materials</li>\n<li>Without viewing them, he cannot seek recusal of biased judges</li>\n<li>Without recusal, he faces trial before potentially biased judges</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>This is a textbook due process violation.</strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-what-the-order-actually-does\">WHAT THE ORDER ACTUALLY DOES</h4>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Despite claiming to be about “security,” the order:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list list-decimal pl-5 my-2\">\n<li><strong>Prevents exposure of judicial ethics violations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Protects biased judges from being identified</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Denies Reardon the right to challenge bias</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allows the government to hide its misconduct</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Ensures the cover-up continues</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-the-government-s-pretextual-findings\">THE GOVERNMENT’S PRETEXTUAL “FINDINGS”</h5>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Judge Whitehurst found:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>Government demonstrated “good cause”</li>\n<li>“Serious potential of harm to individuals” if materials are disseminated</li>\n<li>“Serious potential” that dissemination would reveal “methods or operational behavior”</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\"><strong>But these findings are based solely on the government’s one-sided motion – without hearing from the defense.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-why-security-is-a-lie\">WHY “SECURITY” IS A LIE</h3>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The government’s security concerns are contradicted by their own conduct:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list list-decimal pl-5 my-2\">\n<li><strong>They disclosed the information through FOIA</strong> – if truly sensitive, they wouldn’t have released it</li>\n<li><strong>They filmed the same events Reardon filmed</strong> – no security issue with recording</li>\n<li><strong>They waited 20+ minutes before arresting Reardon</strong> – no urgent security threat</li>\n<li><strong>The emails went to judges, not just security personnel</strong> – not about security operations</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The real concern is <strong>accountability</strong>, not security.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-reardon-s-response-emergency-motion-to-vacate\">REARDON’S RESPONSE: Emergency Motion to Vacate</h4>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Reardon is filing an emergency motion demanding:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list list-decimal pl-5 my-2\">\n<li><strong>Immediate vacation of the Ex Parte Interim Order</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Disclosure of whether Judge Whitehurst received ex parte communications</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Recusal of Judge Whitehurst if she received them</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Full disclosure of all judges who received communications</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Denial of the protective order motion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Full

information”?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Is she protecting her own bias or the bias of other judges</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading text-xl font-bold my-3\" id=\"h-the-stakes\">THE STAKES</h4>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">If this interim order stands:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list list-disc pl-5 my-2\">\n<li>Judges can be secretly prejudiced against defendants</li>\n<li>Defendants can never learn about the bias</li>\n<li>Evidence of judicial ethics violations can be hidden</li>\n<li>The government can coordinate with judges behind closed

Judge Whitehurst granted the government’s motion the same day they filed it—without waiting for my opposition, without any emergency justification. That’s not how justice works.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">There was no emergency. I’ve had these materials for weeks without incident. The only urgency here is their desire to hide evidence of judicial bias before I can expose it.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">If she received those ex parte communications herself, she’s protecting her own bias. If she didn’t, she’s protecting other judges’ bias. Either way, this is a cover-up—and the court is helping them do it.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">I will not be silenced. I will not accept a system where judges can be secretly prejudiced against defendants, and courts help the government hide it. And I will not stop fighting for transparency.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">The government created this scandal by violating judicial ethics rules. They cannot now hide behind ‘security’ to conceal their misconduct.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 font-sans cjk-text whitespace-pre-wrap\">Sunlight is a disinfectant.

They “located” 14 pages of responsive records. They withheld names, details, and routing information under a laundry list of exemptions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What they gave me was enough to confirm the bigger picture: the federal government has been running an organized campaign to monitor, defame, and suppress me for doing my job as an investigative journalist and constitutional rights activist.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-federal-bolos-against-a-journalist\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Federal BOLOs Against a Journalist</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The records included “District Alert Notices” and BOLOs (“Be On the Lookout” bulletins) that plastered my name, my photograph, and my personal identifiers across the federal system.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I was labeled a “First Amendment auditor” — as if exercising constitutional rights is itself a security threat. My private data, including driver’s license number, date of birth, height, and weight, was distributed to Marshals and Court Security Officers in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Utah. I was flagged as someone who should be “closely monitored” in federal courthouses, even though every one of my actions documented in these reports was lawful, peaceful, and backed up by video evidence.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not crime control. This is message control.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-the-false-mayor-stalking-narrative\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>The False “Mayor Stalking” Narrative</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The most damning revelation is the repetition of a false narrative that I was convicted of stalking the mayor of Oxford, Mississippi.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>That is a half truth and a whole lie.</em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/attack-on-the-press/\">In 2022, I entered a plea under coercion</a> — a completely manufactured case built on fabricated evidence and the exploitation of a family crisis. It was never about the mayor. I simply entered City Hall as a Journalist, video documenting my presence, and intent on making a public records request through the City Clerk prior to leaving. This was somehow twisted and mangled into an Aggravated Stalking Charge based on a completely sham restraining order taken out 5 years prior in order to prevent me from speaking at City Hall on June 6, 2017 which just so happened to be Election Day for Mayor Robyn Tannehill. I now make the claim with confidence this “restraining order” was the result of Fraud Committed on The Court by and through the Tannehill’s based upon complete lies, exaggeration, procedural error, and evidence more recently obtained. Even more bizarre was the fact that I was railroaded with this Aggravated Stalking Charge and held without bond like the most dangerous of criminals despite the fact that during my short (less than 20-minute) presence in Oxford, MS City Hall I never asked for Mayor Tannehill and never saw Mayor Tannehill. My purpose for being there was 100% constitutionally protected under the First Amendment and yet I was being openly persecuted as if I had murdered somebody. Not only did the County know I had a newborn son fighting for his life in the NICU at Lebonheur Hospital in Memphis, TN, but my PUBLIC DEFENDER, Mitchell Driskell, actually withdrew as my attorney weeks into representing me and joined the law firm of Rhea Tannehill, the HUSBAND of Mayor Robyn Tannehill. Two weeks after that, my wife gets terminated from her place of employment. Quite Coincidental huh? Particularly with me stuck in jail with no-bond AND having 4 minor children to support (One in the NeoNatal Intensive Care Unit. Yet the USMS records repeat this fiction as fact, treating it as justification for painting me as a danger all while the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice refused to answer the cry for help, showing a complete dereliction of an absolutely crucial duty. <em><a href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/attack-on-the-press/\"><strong>Read more on what happened here and view the video</strong></a></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not a mistake. It is defamation elevated to the federal level, repeated by government officials who either knew or should have known the truth.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-surveillance-as-retaliation\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Surveillance as Retaliation</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">The records show that federal officials didn’t stop at spreading falsehoods. They surveilled me. They logged my presence in courthouses. They tracked my livestreams and YouTube videos. They filed incident reports that described me not as a journalist covering public institutions, but as a suspicious actor to be watched.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This echoes the Eleventh Circuit’s warning in <strong><em><a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-11th-circuit/1123909.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bennett v. Hendrix (2005)</a></em></strong>, where the court condemned campaigns of harassment, intimidation, and database misuse aimed at silencing private citizens. The law is clear: retaliation that would chill a “person of ordinary firmness” from exercising First Amendment rights is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My FOIA results prove that this is exactly what federal agencies have been doing.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-why-the-redactions-matter\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Why the Redactions Matter</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Marshals Service hid behind Exemptions (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(E), and (b)(7)(F). That means:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They redacted names of officials who authored or forwarded these defamatory alerts. They concealed routine routing codes and URLs, pretending that these are “law enforcement techniques.” They withheld details under safety exemptions to protect the very people misusing their positions to target me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Transparency laws weren’t written to protect government misconduct. They were written to expose it. Every redaction here shields wrongdoing.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-the-bigger-picture\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>The Bigger Picture</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">This isn’t about one FOIA request. It’s about a pattern:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Lafayette County and Oxford officials fabricate charges. Federal agencies adopt those falsehoods and hardwire them into nationwide databases. Journalistic activity is reframed as suspicious activity. Redactions then shield the names of those responsible, insulating them from accountability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is cross-jurisdictional retaliation. It is surveillance abuse. It is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-where-it-goes-from-here\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Where It Goes From Here</strong></h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have filed an appeal with the DOJ Office of Information Policy, demanding that these names and withheld details be released. If they deny, I will take this to federal court.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this fight isn’t just mine. It’s about whether federal law enforcement can label peaceful journalists as threats, spread false narratives unchecked, and weaponize information systems against citizens who expose corruption.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The First Amendment doesn’t guarantee comfort for government officials. It guarantees freedom for the people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The U.S. Marshals Service forgot that. And now, thanks to FOIA, the record of their misconduct is public.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">This is far from Reardon’s first run with Corrupt Agencies and Institutional Rot.

California!\" width=\"1300\"></iframe></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">LAFAYETTE, LA — On August 25, 2025, journalist Matthew Oliver Reardon was violently arrested outside the U.S. District Courthouse in Lafayette, Louisiana, for holding a sign reading “Fuck the U.S. Marshals Service.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">The arrest and assault closely parallel the landmark Supreme Court case Cohen v. California (1971), in which the Court overturned a conviction of a man wearing a jacket with the words “Fuck the Draft.” Justice Harlan’s majority opinion declared: “One man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">“The Supreme Court already settled this fifty-four years ago,” Reardon said. “What happened to me is unconstitutional, illegal, and proof of a federal conspiracy to silence journalists.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-violent-assault-by-marshal-hayden-newsom\" style=\"font-size:12px\">Violent Assault by Marshal Hayden Newsom</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">According to Reardon, U.S. Marshal Hayden Newsom baited him into moving his camera away from a locked courthouse door. As Reardon backed up, Newsom slammed him to the ground, destroying a 4K camera, brand-new gimbal, and tripod.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">Inside a holding cell, Newsom allegedly drove his knuckles into Reardon’s chest while he struggled to breathe. When Reardon knocked his arm away in self-defense, Newsom threatened him with a felony charge of “assaulting a federal officer.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">Despite his elevated heart rate (140–160 bpm) and visible distress, medical help was delayed nearly an hour. Paramedics and Newsom accused him of faking to “delay jail.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-unlawful-transfer-and-torture-at-st-martin-parish-jail\" style=\"font-size:15px\"><strong>Unlawful Transfer and Torture at St. Martin Parish Jail</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">After being discharged from the hospital, Reardon was shackled and transferred to St. Martin Parish Deputy Olliviette. When asked what charge he was being booked on, Olliviette admitted there was none—only “a hold for the U.S. Marshals.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">“I told him transporting me without charges is kidnapping under 18 U.S.C. § 1202,” Reardon said. “I reminded him of Nuremberg—that ‘just following orders’ is not a defense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">At St. Martin Parish Jail, Reardon reports being assaulted again. Deputy Olliviette and a female booking officer nearly broke his wrists by hoisting him up by overly tight handcuffs. He was thrown into a freezing cell given only a torn blanket without a mat to lay on the floor.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-foia-records-confirm-conspiracy\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>FOIA Records Confirm Conspiracy</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">Earlier this year, Reardon filed a FOIA request with the U.S. Marshals Service. The agency produced 14 heavily redacted pages referencing nationwide BOLOs and bulletins targeting him for “First Amendment auditing” and journalism .</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">“These redactions now demand full disclosure,” Reardon said. “The documents show foreknowledge. The Marshals knew what they planned to do. And then they carried it out—on camera, in plain daylight.”</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-call-for-accountability\" style=\"font-size:15px\"><strong>Call for Accountability</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"font-size:15px\">Reardon asserts this chain of events constitutes:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Retaliation for protected First Amendment activity.</li>\n<li>Destruction of press equipment in violation of constitutional protections.</li>\n<li>Torture and cruel treatment while in federal and parish custody.</li>\n<li>Kidnapping under federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1202) due to detention without charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">“Marshal Hayden Newsom and Deputy Olliviette tried to silence me through violence and disappearance,” Reardon said. “They failed. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Cohen still stands. And now, so do I.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>See Emergency Fundraiser Here: <a href=\"https://givesendgo.com/fed-assault-and-kidnapping\">https://givesendgo.com/fed-assault-and-kidnapping</a></strong></p>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<p>For Press Inquiries Contact:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Matthew Oliver Reardon</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Journalist, We The People News</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"d2bfa0b7b3a0b6bdbc92a5a6a2bcb7a5a1fcbda0b5\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-16911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16911\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/journalist-violently-arrested-by-federal-agents-for-protected-speech/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-16911\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-16911\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-16911\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/journalist-violently-arrested-by-federal-agents-for-protected-speech/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-16911\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-16911\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-16911\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/journalist-violently-arrested-by-federal-agents-for-protected-speech/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-16911\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-16911\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

Doe threatening protest organizers with liability, and states like Texas and Louisiana punishing lawful conduct with unconstitutional overreach, the terrain has shifted. Activists need to understand not just what the Constitution says, but how it’s applied — or ignored — in their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This tool is your map through that legal minefield.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nbsp-try-it-now\">🔗 Try It Now</h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">💻 <a href=\"https://crn.wtpnews.org\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Access the Constitutional Rights Legal Research Tool →</a> or simply scroll to the end of this article.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Explore your state.

When I finished, she cut me off:<br/><em>“I need to send you to the commissioner’s office.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s when it hit me: in Mississippi’s corrections system, even accountability has to be forwarded.</p>\n<p>I made it clear who I was — <em>Don Matthews with We the People News</em> — and that the story would run by five o’clock if Commissioner Burl Cain didn’t call me back. Only then did her tone shift. The room on the other end of the line seemed to wake up.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I’ll have someone look into it,”</em> she finally said.<br/><em>“That’s what the people need to hear,”</em> I told her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that’s where this story begins.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-reports-from-inside\"><strong>The Reports from Inside</strong></h3>\n<p>Multiple sources from Delta Correctional have told me the same thing: there’s no grievance box. No ILAP box. No confidential way for an inmate to file a request or complaint.</p>\n<p>Instead, if an inmate wants to report abuse or mistreatment, they to hand the form to a guard — possibly the very guard they are reporting. That isn’t procedure; that’s intimidation by design.</p>\n<p>Mail? Same story. No mailbox. No locked drop point. The only “system” is giving it directly to a corrections officer on night shift.</p>\n<p>One inmate put it simply:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“They say we can grieve, but we can’t even drop the paper.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-the-law-says\"><strong>What the Law Says</strong></h3>\n<p>The law isn’t vague on this. In <em>Bounds v. Smith</em> (1977), the U.S. Supreme Court held that prisons must provide inmates with “meaningful access to the courts.” That includes the right to file grievances and legal assistance requests.</p>\n<p>Two decades later, in <em>Lewis v. Casey</em> (1996), the Court reaffirmed that right — and made clear that when prison officials obstruct it, they violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Then there’s <em>Farmer v. Brennan</em> (1994), which established that officials who show “deliberate indifference” to known risks or constitutional violations can be held liable under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>So when MDOC ignores reports that inmates have no safe way to file grievances, that’s not a paperwork problem. That’s a constitutional one.</p>\n<p>Even MDOC’s own internal policy — Administrative Remedy Program (ARP), Policy 20-08 — mandates accessible, confidential grievance procedures. “Confidential” doesn’t mean slipping a form to a guard who controls your daily life.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bureaucratic-deflection\"><strong>The Bureaucratic Deflection</strong></h3>\n<p>When I raised these issues, the response from the commissioner’s office was not outrage, not even concern — just redirection.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I can’t comment on that… I’ll have someone look into it.”</em><br/><em>“He’s not in the office right now.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tone was polite, careful, professional — the kind of tone that gets people through their workday but never fixes anything.</p>\n<p>If you listen closely to the call, you can hear something more subtle: a system that’s learned to protect itself. Every question gets rerouted. Every responsibility diluted. By the time it’s “looked into,” the problem has already gone quiet again.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-cost-of-silence\"><strong>The Cost of Silence</strong></h3>\n<p>What’s happening at Delta Correctional isn’t unique — it’s just quieter there. At Parchman, the neglect made headlines. At Delta, it hides behind procedure.</p>\n<p>A grievance system that doesn’t function is more than a missing box; it’s a message. It tells the men inside that their voices don’t count. It tells the guards they can act without oversight. And it tells the public that “corrections” in Mississippi still means control, not rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>One source told me she’d never had a problem at Delta but didn’t want to be retaliated against for speaking up. That line alone says it all: when the fear of retaliation outweighs the faith in justice, the Constitution becomes a ghost in its own house.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-comes-next\"><strong>What Comes Next</strong></h3>\n<p>As of publication, Commissioner Burl Cain has not returned my call. His office did say they would “look into the ILA procedure” at Delta Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p>Looking is one thing. Fixing is another.</p>\n<p>The Constitution doesn’t take weekends off, and it doesn’t stop at the prison gate. If the State of Mississippi is serious about justice, it can start by giving its inmates something simple — a locked box, a piece of paper, and the right to be heard without fear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-17118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17118\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/no-box-for-justice-inside-mississippis-broken-prison-grievance-system/?share=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-facebook-17118\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-x\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-x-17118\" class=\"share-x sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-x-17118\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/no-box-for-justice-inside-mississippis-broken-prison-grievance-system/?share=x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-x-17118\">Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>X</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-print-17118\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" data-shared=\"sharing-print-17118\" href=\"https://www.wtpnews.org/no-box-for-justice-inside-mississippis-broken-prison-grievance-system/#print?share=print\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span hidden=\"\" id=\"sharing-print-17118\">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span>\n<span>Print</span>\n</a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a aria-labelledby=\"sharing-email-17118\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" data-email-share-error-text=\"If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
